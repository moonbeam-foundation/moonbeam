# PR #6827 Impact Analysis: Introduction of Approval Slashes

## Overview
- **PR Title**: Introduction of Approval Slashes [Disabling Strategy Stage 4]
- **Polkadot-SDK PR**: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6827
- **Labels**: `I1-security`, `T8-polkadot`, `A4-backport-stable2503`
- **Affected Crates**:
  - `polkadot-primitives` (minor bump)
  - `polkadot-runtime-parachains` (major bump)

## Change Summary

This PR implements Stage 4 of a new disabling strategy for the Polkadot relay chain, introducing differentiated slashing penalties for validators based on their role in disputes:

1. **ForInvalidBacked** (100% slash) - For backing validators who backed invalid blocks
2. **ForInvalidApproved** (2% slash) - For approval validators who approved invalid blocks (lazy validators)
3. **AgainstValid** (0% slash + disabled) - For validators who disputed valid blocks (false alarms)

### Technical Changes
- Modified `SlashingHandler` trait: Changed `punish_for_invalid()` signature to distinguish backers from other validators
- Added new `DisputeOffenceKind` enum in `polkadot-primitives::vstaging`
- Updated slashing logic in `polkadot-runtime-parachains::disputes::slashing`

## Impact Assessment for Moonbeam

### Impact Level: **NONE** ❌

### Rationale

This PR is **completely relay chain specific** and has **zero impact** on Moonbeam for the following reasons:

#### 1. **Parachain Architecture**
Moonbeam is a parachain, not a relay chain validator. Dispute resolution and validator slashing are relay chain consensus mechanisms that parachains do not directly participate in or implement.

#### 2. **Dependency Analysis**

**From `polkadot-primitives`:**
Moonbeam only imports host configuration types:
```rust
// node/service/src/lib.rs:59
use polkadot_primitives::{AbridgedHostConfiguration, AsyncBackingParams, Slot, UpgradeGoAhead};
```
These types are **unrelated to disputes or slashing** - they are configuration data that parachains receive from the relay chain.

**From `polkadot-runtime-parachains`:**
Moonbeam only uses this crate in:
- **Test code**: XCM mock relay chain tests import modules like `configuration`, `dmp`, `hrmp`, `paras`, and `shared`
- **relay-encoder tests**: Uses `hrmp::Call` for encoding HRMP channel operations

None of these imports are related to the `disputes::slashing` module modified by this PR.

#### 3. **Runtime Verification**
Examination of Moonbeam's runtime construction shows **no dispute-related pallets**:
```rust
// runtime/moonbase/src/lib.rs:1414
construct_runtime! {
    pub enum Runtime {
        System, Utility, Timestamp, Balances, Sudo,
        ParachainSystem, TransactionPayment, ParachainInfo,
        EthereumChainId, EVM, Ethereum, ParachainStaking,
        // ... (no dispute-related pallets)
    }
}
```

#### 4. **Code Search Results**
- **No direct usage** of `SlashingHandler` trait
- **No imports** of `SlashingOffenceKind`, `ForInvalidBacked`, `ForInvalidApproved`, or `AgainstValid`
- **No dispute-related logic** in Moonbeam's runtime code
- TypeScript type definitions (`DisputeStatementSet`, `SlashingOffenceKind`) are auto-generated from chain metadata but **not actually used** by Moonbeam

#### 5. **API Compatibility**
The major bump in `polkadot-runtime-parachains` is due to the breaking change in `SlashingHandler::punish_for_invalid()` signature. Since Moonbeam:
- Does not implement `SlashingHandler` trait
- Does not use the disputes module
- Only uses HRMP and configuration modules (unchanged by this PR)

The API breaking change **does not affect Moonbeam**.

## Evidence

### Dependency Usage
```
/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/node/service/src/lib.rs:59
use polkadot_primitives::{AbridgedHostConfiguration, AsyncBackingParams, Slot, UpgradeGoAhead};

/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonbase/tests/xcm_mock/relay_chain.rs:31-34
use polkadot_runtime_parachains::{
    configuration, dmp, hrmp,
    inclusion::{AggregateMessageOrigin, UmpQueueId},
    origin, paras, shared,
};

/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/relay-encoder/src/westend.rs:665
// Test only: polkadot_runtime_parachains::hrmp::Call
```

### Grep Search Results
```bash
# No dispute-related code usage
$ grep -r "SlashingHandler\|ForInvalid\|AgainstValid" runtime/
# No matches

# No dispute offence kind usage
$ grep -r "DisputeOffenceKind" runtime/
# No matches

# TypeScript types exist but are not used
$ grep -r "SlashingOffenceKind" typescript-api/
typescript-api/src/moonbase/interfaces/augment-types.ts:2436: SlashingOffenceKind: SlashingOffenceKind;
# (auto-generated, not used in Moonbeam logic)
```

## Migration Requirements

**None required.** This change is transparent to parachains.

## Testing Recommendations

**None required.** Since Moonbeam does not use any dispute-related functionality, no testing is needed.

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level: None**

- ✅ No code changes needed
- ✅ No runtime migration needed
- ✅ No client changes needed
- ✅ No API compatibility issues
- ✅ No testing requirements

## Conclusion

PR #6827 introduces approval slashing for relay chain validators during dispute resolution. This is purely relay chain consensus logic that does not affect parachain runtimes like Moonbeam.

While `polkadot-runtime-parachains` received a major version bump due to the breaking `SlashingHandler` trait change, Moonbeam only uses unrelated modules (HRMP, configuration) from this crate and is therefore unaffected.

**No action required** for this PR during the stable2506 upgrade.
