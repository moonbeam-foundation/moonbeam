### PR Information
- **PR Doc**: [pr_7220.prdoc](/Users/manuelmauro/.substrate-mcp/moonbeam/releases/stable2506/pr-docs/pr_7220.prdoc)
- **GitHub PR**: [#7220](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7220)
- **PR Title**: YAP NG FTW! (Yet Another Parachain)

### Impact Assessment
- **Initial Sentiment**: INHERITED
- **Confidence Level**: HIGH based on codebase analysis and workspace dependency patterns

### Analysis
**Affected Components**:
- New testing runtime: `yet-another-parachain-runtime` (not used by Moonbeam)
- Workspace-level crate version bumps (no API changes)

**Changes Detected in polkadot-sdk**:
This PR introduces "Yet Another Parachain" (YAP), a new testing parachain runtime primarily designed for Spammening events and general-purpose testing. The PR includes:
- New runtime: `yet-another-parachain-runtime` with experimental UMP signals enabled
- Configuration for elastic scaling testing
- Increased RPC subscriptions and connection limits
- Modified transaction pool settings for performance testing

**Crates with Version Bumps** (all minor bumps):
- `yet-another-parachain-runtime` (new)
- `polkadot-parachain-bin`
- `sc-basic-authorship`
- `sc-transaction-pool`
- `cumulus-pov-validator`
- `sc-network-transactions`
- `sc-service`
- `sc-network`
- `frame-system`

**Project Impact**:
- Moonbeam does NOT use the `yet-another-parachain-runtime`
- The version bumps are workspace-level changes with NO breaking API changes
- All affected crates are used by Moonbeam but only received minor version bumps
- No code changes required in Moonbeam's codebase

**Verification of No API Changes**:
Searched Moonbeam codebase for usage of affected crates:
- `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/node/service/Cargo.toml` - Dependencies include `sc-basic-authorship`, `sc-network`, `sc-service`, `sc-transaction-pool`
- `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/node/service/src/lib.rs:L1006` - Uses `sc_basic_authorship::ProposerFactory::with_proof_recording()` (unchanged)
- `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/node/service/src/lib.rs:L544` - Uses `sc_transaction_pool::Builder::new()` (unchanged)
- `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/node/service/src/lib.rs:L66` - Uses `sc_network` types (unchanged)
- All runtime Cargo.toml files include `frame-system` as a core dependency (unchanged)

**Search Results**:
- `grep -r "yet-another-parachain"` - Only found in `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/tools/package-lock.json` (unrelated Node.js dependency)
- No references to YAP runtime in Moonbeam's Rust codebase

### Evidence & References
**From PR (polkadot-sdk)**:
- This PR ports "Yet Another Parachain" to the latest master branch
- Purpose: Testing parachain for Spammening events and general stress testing
- Enabled experimental features like UMP signals and elastic scaling
- All crate bumps are "minor" versions, indicating no breaking changes

**From Project (moonbeam)**:
- Current branch: `moonbeam-polkadot-stable2506`
- Polkadot SDK dependency: `git+https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/polkadot-sdk?branch=moonbeam-polkadot-stable2506#c5698d1a20558313657b45fc56dc1582772e2d1d`
- Changes in `node/service/src/lib.rs` are from OTHER PRs in the stable2506 upgrade, not from PR #7220
- The git diff shows changes related to:
  - `build_relay_chain_interface` tuple extraction (different PR)
  - `metrics` parameter addition (different PR)
  - `prometheus_registry` parameter addition (different PR)

**Migration Guide**:
- No migration required
- No code changes required
- The crate version bumps are inherited automatically from the workspace dependency upgrade
- Moonbeam benefits from any internal improvements or bug fixes in the affected crates without needing code changes

**Additional Resources**:
- PR Context: https://polkadot.com/spammening/ - Information about Spammening stress testing events
- YAP is a testing tool, not a production runtime
- This change is completely transparent to Moonbeam as a consumer of the polkadot-sdk workspace
