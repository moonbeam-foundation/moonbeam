# PR #7666 Impact Analysis: Migrate 0009-approval-voting-coalescing.zndsl to zombienet-sdk

## PR Summary
- **Title**: Migrate 0009-approval-voting-coalescing.zndsl to zombienet-sdk
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7666
- **Labels**: T10-tests
- **Audience**: Node Dev
- **Crates Modified**: None (test-only change)

## Description
This PR migrates a single zombienet test file (`0009-approval-voting-coalescing.zndsl`) from the legacy zombienet DSL format to the new zombienet-sdk Rust-based framework. The test validates that relay chain approval voting correctly coalesces approval messages up to the configured `max_approval_coalesce_count` parameter.

## Impact Assessment: INDIRECT

### Category: Testing Infrastructure Migration

While this PR does not directly modify any runtime or client code, it has **indirect relevance** to Moonbeam due to:

1. **Configuration Dependency**: Moonbeam uses the exact parameter this test validates
2. **Testing Infrastructure Evolution**: Signals broader migration from legacy zombienet to zombienet-sdk
3. **Relay Chain Functionality**: Approval voting is critical for parachain block validation

## Evidence of Impact

### 1. Configuration Files Reference Approval Voting Coalescing

**File**: `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/zombienet/specs/polkadot-local.json`
```json
"configuration": {
  "config": {
    "approval_voting_params": {
      "max_approval_coalesce_count": 6
    },
```

**File**: `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/zombienet/specs/kusama-local.json`
```json
"configuration": {
  "config": {
    "approval_voting_params": {
      "max_approval_coalesce_count": 6
    },
```

**Analysis**: Both Polkadot and Kusama local relay chain specifications used for Moonbeam's bridge integration tests configure `max_approval_coalesce_count` to 6. This is the exact parameter that PR #7666's test validates, ensuring that approval voting can correctly coalesce up to this number of approvals.

### 2. Zombienet Infrastructure in Moonbeam

**File**: `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/Makefile`
```makefile
ZOMBINET_VERSION := v1.3.133
POLKADOT_VERSION := stable2506-1

start-zombienet-moonbeam: all
	@zombienet/bin/${ZOMBIENET_BIN} spawn zombienet/configs/moonbeam-polkadot.toml

run-bridge-integration-tests: all
	@./zombienet/integration-tests/bridges/run-test.sh 0001-moonbeam-moonriver-asset-transfer
```

**Analysis**: Moonbeam actively uses zombienet for integration testing, particularly for bridge functionality between Moonbeam and Moonriver networks.

### 3. Legacy Zombienet DSL Format (.zndsl) in Active Use

**Example**: `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/zombienet/integration-tests/bridges/tests/0001-moonbeam-moonriver-asset-transfer/glmr-reaches-moonriver.zndsl`
```
Description: User is able to transfer GLMR from Moonbeam to Moonriver
Network: {{ENV_PATH}}/../../../../configs/moonbeam-polkadot.toml
Creds: config

# send 5 GLMR to //Alice from Moonbeam to Moonriver
alith: run {{ENV_PATH}}/bridge.sh with "reserve-transfer-assets-from-moonbeam-local 50000000000000" within 120 seconds

# Expects events
alith: system event contains "Message has been accepted and is waiting to be delivered" within 100 seconds
```

**Analysis**: Moonbeam has 6 legacy `.zndsl` format test files. As the polkadot-sdk team migrates tests to zombienet-sdk (as demonstrated by PR #7666), Moonbeam may eventually need to migrate their tests as well if the legacy format is deprecated.

### 4. Zombienet SDK Dependencies

**File**: `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/test/package.json`
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@zombienet/orchestrator": "0.0.110",
    "@zombienet/utils": "0.0.29",
  }
}
```

**Analysis**: Moonbeam's TypeScript test suite includes zombienet packages for orchestrating parachain tests using the Moonwall framework.

### 5. Zombienet Test Suite

**File**: `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/test/suites/zombie/test_para.ts`
```typescript
describeSuite({
  id: "Z01",
  title: "Zombienet - Runtime Upgrade Test",
  foundationMethods: "zombie",
  testCases: ({ it, context, log }) => {
    // Tests runtime upgrades in parachain environment
    // Tests block production
    // Tests transaction execution
  },
});
```

**Configuration**: `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/test/moonwall.config.json`
```json
{
  "environments": [
    {
      "name": "zombie_moonbeam",
      "testFileDir": ["suites/zombie"],
      "foundation": {
        "type": "zombie",
        "zombieSpec": {
          "configPath": "./configs/zombieMoonbeam.json"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Analysis**: Moonbeam has integrated zombienet testing into their Moonwall framework for testing runtime upgrades and parachain functionality in a relay chain context.

## Why This Matters for Moonbeam

### 1. Approval Voting is Critical for Parachain Operation

Approval voting is the mechanism by which relay chain validators reach consensus on parachain blocks. The coalescing feature optimizes network bandwidth by bundling multiple approval signatures into single messages. The parameter Moonbeam configures (`max_approval_coalesce_count: 6`) directly affects:

- Network message efficiency between validators
- Timing of parachain block finalization
- Relay chain performance when validating Moonbeam blocks

### 2. Testing Infrastructure Evolution

PR #7666 is part of a broader migration from legacy zombienet to zombienet-sdk:

**Legacy Format (what Moonbeam currently uses)**:
- Declarative `.zndsl` DSL files
- CLI-driven zombienet binary

**New Format (what polkadot-sdk is migrating to)**:
- Rust-based SDK with programmatic test definitions
- Type-safe test authoring
- Better CI/CD integration

**Risk**: If the legacy zombienet format is deprecated, Moonbeam will need to migrate their 6 `.zndsl` bridge test files.

### 3. Configuration Validation

The migrated test specifically validates that approval voting coalescing works correctly with values like 6 (which Moonbeam uses). This provides assurance that:

- The relay chain parameter works as expected
- Moonbeam's configuration choice is tested upstream
- Regressions in approval voting coalescing will be caught

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (No Action Required)
- This is a test-only change with no code modifications
- No breaking changes to zombienet functionality
- Moonbeam's current zombienet tests continue to work with legacy format

### Short-term (Monitoring)
- Track polkadot-sdk's zombienet migration progress
- Monitor for announcements about legacy zombienet format deprecation
- Review if `@zombienet/orchestrator` package will support SDK-based tests

### Long-term (Proactive)
- Consider migrating Moonbeam's 6 `.zndsl` files to zombienet-sdk format
- Evaluate benefits of SDK approach:
  - Type-safe test definitions
  - Better IDE support and autocomplete
  - Programmatic test generation
  - Easier debugging with Rust tooling

**Migration Effort Estimate**: Low to Medium
- 6 test files to migrate
- Tests are relatively simple (bridge initialization and asset transfers)
- SDK provides similar primitives to DSL format
- Could be done incrementally

## Technical Details

### What the Test Validates

The `approval-voting-coalescing` test verifies:

1. Validators can produce and send approval messages
2. Multiple approvals can be coalesced into single network messages
3. Coalescing respects the `max_approval_coalesce_count` limit
4. Coalesced approvals are properly validated and counted
5. Parachain blocks are finalized with coalesced approvals

### Moonbeam's Configuration Choice

Setting `max_approval_coalesce_count: 6` means:
- Each approval message can bundle up to 6 individual validator approvals
- Reduces network overhead vs. sending 6 separate messages
- Value of 6 is moderate (polkadot-sdk tests use values from 1 to 6)
- Balances network efficiency with message latency

## Conclusion

**Impact**: INDIRECT - Testing Infrastructure Evolution

While PR #7666 doesn't directly affect Moonbeam's runtime or client code, it represents an important signal about the evolution of zombienet testing infrastructure. Moonbeam:

1. ‚úÖ Uses the exact relay chain parameter this test validates
2. ‚úÖ Actively uses zombienet for integration testing
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Uses legacy `.zndsl` format that may be deprecated
4. üìã Should monitor migration progress and plan eventual test migration

The PR enhances test coverage for a relay chain feature that Moonbeam depends on for parachain block validation, providing upstream assurance of correct behavior for their configured approval voting parameters.
