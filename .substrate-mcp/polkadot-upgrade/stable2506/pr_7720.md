# PR #7720: Clamp Core Fellowship Benchmarks to Runtime MaxRank Configuration

## Impact Assessment: NO IMPACT

**Status**: Safe to ignore - Not applicable to Moonbeam

## Summary

PR #7720 modifies the `pallet-core-fellowship` to fix benchmarking issues by clamping benchmark ranks to respect runtime `MaxRank` configuration. This involves a breaking change: the `MaxRank` type is changed from `u32` to `u16`, requiring runtime developers to update their configuration from `ConstU32<N>` to `ConstU16<N>`.

## What Changed

### Technical Changes
1. **Type Change**: `MaxRank` type modified from `u32` to `u16` (breaking change)
2. **Benchmark Fixes**: Added dynamic rank clamping using `.min()` to respect maximum rank limits
3. **Affected Pallets**: `pallet-core-fellowship` (major version bump)

### Problem Being Solved
The core-fellowship benchmarks had critical issues:
- Compile-time rank values didn't align with runtime `MaxRank` configurations
- Static rank assumptions in benchmarks (e.g., hardcoded rank 2) failed with constrained configurations like `MaxRank=1`
- Parameter mismatches between generated benchmark metadata and actual runtime settings

### Breaking Changes
Runtime developers using `pallet-core-fellowship` must change:
```rust
// Before
type MaxRank = ConstU32<N>;

// After
type MaxRank = ConstU16<N>;
```

## Impact on Moonbeam

### Evidence of No Impact

**Comprehensive Search Results:**

1. **Runtime Configuration Analysis**
   - Searched all three runtime configurations:
     - `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonbeam/src/lib.rs`
     - `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonriver/src/lib.rs`
     - `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonbase/src/lib.rs`
   - **Result**: No `pallet-core-fellowship` in any `construct_runtime!` macro

2. **Codebase Search**
   - Searched for patterns: `core-fellowship`, `CoreFellowship`, `pallet-core-fellowship`, `pallet_core_fellowship`
   - Searched for: `Fellowship`, `fellowship`, `MaxRank`
   - **Result**: No matches in any Moonbeam source files (only found in upgrade tracking documents)

3. **Dependency Analysis**
   - Searched all `Cargo.toml` files for `pallet-core-fellowship` dependency
   - Searched `Cargo.lock` for fellowship-related packages
   - **Result**: No fellowship-related dependencies found

4. **Pallet Inventory**
   Moonbeam's runtime pallets include:
   - Governance: Referenda, ConvictionVoting, Whitelist, Origins, Preimage, Scheduler
   - Consensus: ParachainStaking, AuthorMapping, AuthorFilter, MoonbeamOrbiters
   - EVM: Ethereum, EVM, EthereumChainId
   - XCM: PolkadotXcm, XcmpQueue, XcmTransactor
   - Utilities: Proxy, Identity, Multisig, Utility, Treasury
   - **Note**: No fellowship or collective ranking pallets

### Why This Makes Sense

Moonbeam is an Ethereum-compatible parachain focused on:
- EVM smart contract execution
- Ethereum-style transaction processing
- Cross-chain asset transfers via XCM
- Collator-based consensus (ParachainStaking)

The `pallet-core-fellowship` is designed for Polkadot/Kusama collective governance and member ranking systems, which is not part of Moonbeam's architecture. Moonbeam uses a different governance model based on OpenGov (Referenda + ConvictionVoting) without fellowship ranks.

## Required Actions

### For Moonbeam Team
**None** - This PR does not affect Moonbeam.

### Rationale
- The `pallet-core-fellowship` is not used in any Moonbeam runtime (moonbeam, moonriver, moonbase)
- No configuration changes required
- No migration needed
- No testing required
- No code updates necessary

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Verify no fellowship pallet usage
grep -r "core-fellowship\|CoreFellowship\|pallet-core-fellowship" runtime/

# Verify no fellowship dependency
grep "pallet-core-fellowship" runtime/*/Cargo.toml

# Confirm runtime pallets
grep "construct_runtime!" runtime/*/src/lib.rs -A 80
```

## Related Information

- **PR Link**: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7720
- **PR Labels**: T2-pallets
- **Affected Pallet**: pallet-core-fellowship
- **Breaking Change**: Yes (for pallet users only)
- **Moonbeam Impact**: None

## Conclusion

PR #7720 introduces a breaking change to `pallet-core-fellowship` but has **zero impact** on Moonbeam since the pallet is not used in any of Moonbeam's runtimes. This PR can be safely ignored during the stable2506 upgrade process.
