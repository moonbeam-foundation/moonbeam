# PR #7833 Impact Analysis: Add poke_deposit extrinsic to pallet-society

## PR Information
- **Title**: add poke_deposit extrinsic to pallet-society
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7833
- **Labels**: T1-FRAME, T2-pallets
- **Crate**: pallet-society (major bump)

## Summary
This PR introduces a new `poke_deposit` extrinsic to `pallet-society`, allowing users to re-adjust deposits made when creating bids. The extrinsic is designed to be cost-efficient: free if an actual adjustment is made, paid otherwise.

## Changes Made
- **New Extrinsic**: `poke_deposit()` - enables deposit adjustment following parameter changes
- **New Event**: `DepositPoked` - emitted when deposit is successfully adjusted with old and new values
- **New Error**: `NoDeposit` - returned when a non-bidder attempts to poke deposit
- **Benchmarking**: Added comprehensive benchmarks (181.42Î¼s for poke_deposit)
- **Testing**: Multiple test cases covering various deposit adjustment scenarios

## Impact Assessment: INHERITED

### Evidence
Searched the Moonbeam codebase for usage of `pallet-society`:

```bash
# Search for pallet-society in runtime directory
$ grep -ri "pallet-society" runtime/
# No matches found

# Search for Society pallet references in runtime
$ grep -r "\bSociety\b" runtime/
# No matches found

# Checked runtime Cargo.toml files
$ grep "pallet-society" runtime/*/Cargo.toml
# No matches found
```

### Conclusion
**Moonbeam does NOT use pallet-society** in any of its runtimes (moonbeam, moonriver, moonbase). The pallet is not:
- Listed as a dependency in any runtime Cargo.toml
- Included in any `construct_runtime!` macro
- Referenced anywhere in the runtime code

### Rationale for INHERITED Classification
While this PR is part of the stable2506 release and will be included in the Polkadot SDK upgrade, it has **zero functional impact** on Moonbeam since the project does not use `pallet-society`. The changes are inherited passively as part of the broader SDK update but require no action, testing, or consideration from the Moonbeam team.

## Action Items
- None required

## Additional Notes
This is a targeted enhancement to pallet-society's deposit management system. Since Moonbeam focuses on Ethereum compatibility and uses a different set of pallets (primarily EVM-related, XCM, staking, governance via Referenda/ConvictionVoting), the Society pallet is not part of its architecture.
