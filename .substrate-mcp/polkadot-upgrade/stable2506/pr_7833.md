# PR #7833 Impact Analysis: Add poke_deposit Extrinsic to pallet-society

## Summary

**PR Title:** Add poke_deposit extrinsic to pallet-society

**GitHub PR:** https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7833

**Impact Category:** OPTIONAL

**Affected Pallet:** pallet-society

**Requires Action:** No

## PR Overview

This PR adds a new `poke_deposit` extrinsic to `pallet-society`. The extrinsic is designed to re-adjust deposits made in the pallet to create a bid after Account Hierarchy Migration (AHM). According to the PRDoc and GitHub discussion, this functionality is needed to handle cases where deposit amounts need to be adjusted, whether they decrease or increase.

### Key Changes

1. **New Extrinsic**: `poke_deposit` - allows re-adjustment of deposits
2. **New Event**: `DepositPoked` - emitted when the extrinsic successfully adjusts a deposit
3. **Fee Structure**: Free when an actual deposit adjustment occurs, paid otherwise
4. **Limitations**: Only handles deposit-type bids (not vouch-type bids)

### Technical Details

- **Error Handling**: Returns `NoDeposit` error if no deposit is found
- **Deposit Management**: Properly manages both increasing and decreasing deposit scenarios
- **Benchmarking**: Execution time measured at 181.42 microseconds
- **Breaking Change**: Marked as a major version bump for pallet-society

## Impact on Moonbeam

### Codebase Analysis

**Search Results:**
- Searched for `pallet-society`, `pallet_society`, and `Society` across the Moonbeam codebase
- Checked all runtime Cargo.toml files:
  - `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonbeam/Cargo.toml` - No pallet-society dependency
  - `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonriver/Cargo.toml` - No pallet-society dependency
  - `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonbase/Cargo.toml` - No pallet-society dependency
- Searched runtime source files for Society configurations - No matches found

### Conclusion

**pallet-society is not used in any Moonbeam runtime (moonbeam, moonriver, or moonbase).**

Since Moonbeam does not use pallet-society in any of its runtime configurations, this PR has **no impact** on the Moonbeam project. The addition of the `poke_deposit` extrinsic only affects chains that have pallet-society configured in their runtime.

## Impact Category Justification

**Category: OPTIONAL**

This PR is categorized as OPTIONAL because:
1. Moonbeam does not use pallet-society in any runtime
2. No code changes are required
3. No testing is required
4. No migration is needed
5. The changes are entirely confined to a pallet that is not part of Moonbeam's architecture

## Recommendation

**No action required.** This PR can be safely included in the Polkadot SDK upgrade without any modifications to Moonbeam's codebase.
