# PR #8130: Move archive MethodResult to Archive Module

## Summary

This PR reorganizes code within the `sc-rpc-spec-v2` crate by moving `MethodResult`, `MethodResultOk`, and `MethodResultErr` types from their previous location to the archive module (`substrate/client/rpc-spec-v2/src/archive/mod.rs`). This is purely a code organization change that groups archive-specific types with their related functionality.

## PR Details

- **Title**: rpc v2: move archive MethodResult to the archive mod
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8130
- **Labels**: T0-node
- **Status**: Merged on April 7, 2025
- **Crate Changes**: `sc-rpc-spec-v2` (major bump)

## Changes Made

1. Moved `MethodResult`, `MethodResultOk`, and `MethodResultErr` types to the archive module
2. Created a new types module within the archive module
3. Updated import statements across the codebase to reference the new location
4. Maintained backward compatibility through proper public exports

## Impact on Moonbeam

**Level**: INHERITED

### Analysis

1. **Direct Dependency**: Moonbeam does NOT have a direct dependency on `sc-rpc-spec-v2` in any `Cargo.toml` files
2. **Type Usage**: No usage of `MethodResult`, `MethodResultOk`, or `MethodResultErr` found in the Moonbeam codebase
3. **Transitive Dependency**: The crate appears only in `Cargo.lock` as a transitive dependency

### Rationale

This is a purely internal refactoring within the `sc-rpc-spec-v2` crate that:
- Does not change any public API behavior
- Does not affect any code that Moonbeam directly uses
- Will be automatically handled through Cargo dependency resolution when updating Polkadot SDK dependencies

The major version bump is likely due to Polkadot SDK's versioning policy for internal reorganizations, but since Moonbeam doesn't directly depend on or use these types, no action is required.

## Required Actions

**None** - This change is automatically inherited through the Polkadot SDK dependency update with no code changes needed in Moonbeam.

## Additional Notes

This PR is part of ongoing code organization improvements in the Polkadot SDK RPC v2 implementation, grouping related types together for better maintainability. The change is transparent to consumers of the crate who don't directly use these archive-specific types.
