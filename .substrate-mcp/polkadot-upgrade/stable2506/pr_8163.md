# PR #8163: Idiomatic Rust Cleanup

## Summary

Non-functional refactoring PR that improves code readability and consistency with modern Rust practices. The changes are purely cosmetic and do not alter runtime behavior or public APIs.

## PR Details

- **Title**: chore: idiomatic rust cleanup
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8163
- **Labels**: T2-pallets
- **Audience**: Runtime Dev

## Changes Overview

This PR performs non-functional refactors across multiple files:

### 1. Division Optimization
Replaced manual ceiling division `(x + 1) / 2` with `div_ceil()`:
- `snowbridge-merkle-tree/src/lib.rs`: `(next.len() + 1) / 2` → `next.len().div_ceil(2)`
- `substrate/bin/node/runtime/src/genesis_config_presets.rs`: `((endowed_accounts_count + 1) / 2)` → `endowed_accounts_count.div_ceil(2)`
- `pallet-tips/src/lib.rs`: `(T::Tippers::count() + 1) / 2` → `T::Tippers::count().div_ceil(2)`

### 2. Pattern Match Simplification
Replaced verbose pattern matching with concise alternatives:
- `pallet-democracy/src/lib.rs`: Simplified if-else chain to `.err()` method
- `pallet-revive/src/evm/api/rlp_codec.rs`: Replaced verbose match with `.ok()` method

### 3. Crates with Patch Bumps
- pallet-xcm-bridge-hub (no direct code changes)
- snowbridge-merkle-tree
- snowbridge-outbound-queue-primitives
- staging-xcm-builder
- pallet-democracy
- pallet-revive
- pallet-tips

## Moonbeam Impact Analysis

### Affected Components

**Used by Moonbeam:**
- `pallet-xcm-bridge-hub` (imported as `pallet-xcm-bridge`) - NO code changes in this pallet

**Not Used by Moonbeam:**
- `pallet-democracy` - Not a dependency
- `pallet-tips` - Not a dependency
- `pallet-revive` - Not a dependency
- `snowbridge-merkle-tree` - Not a dependency

### Code Search Results

Searched Moonbeam codebase for:
- `pallet-democracy`: Not found (except in analysis docs)
- `pallet-tips`: Not found (except in analysis docs)
- `pallet-revive`: Not found (except in analysis docs)
- `snowbridge-merkle-tree`: Not found
- `div_ceil`: Not currently used in Moonbeam codebase

### Files Using pallet-xcm-bridge

The following files import or configure `pallet-xcm-bridge`:
- `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonbeam/src/lib.rs`
- `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonbeam/src/bridge_config.rs`
- `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonriver/src/lib.rs`
- `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonriver/src/bridge_config.rs`
- `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/common/src/bridge.rs`

However, **no code changes were made to pallet-xcm-bridge-hub itself** - it received only a patch version bump due to workspace dependencies.

## Impact Level: INHERITED

**Rationale:**
1. The PR consists entirely of non-functional refactors (style improvements)
2. No runtime behavior changes
3. No public API changes
4. Moonbeam does not use any of the pallets that received actual code modifications
5. The `pallet-xcm-bridge-hub` dependency had no code changes, only a version bump
6. PR explicitly states: "downstream projects should experience no impact"

## Required Actions

**None** - These changes will be inherited automatically through the Polkadot SDK dependency upgrade.

## Integration Notes

From the PR documentation:
> "No integration steps are required. These are non-functional refactors that do not alter the runtime behavior or public APIs. Downstream projects should experience no impact."

## Testing Recommendations

No specific testing required beyond standard regression testing for the Polkadot SDK upgrade, as:
1. No behavioral changes were introduced
2. Moonbeam doesn't use the pallets that had code modifications
3. All changes preserve original behavior (validated by upstream testing)

## Additional Context

This PR is part of an ongoing effort to modernize and improve code quality across the Polkadot SDK codebase. The changes align with Rust 1.73+ features (such as `div_ceil()`) and idiomatic patterns.
