# PR #8171 Impact Analysis

## PR Summary
**Title:** Add missing vested transfer event
**PR:** https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8171
**Labels:** T2-pallets
**Merged:** April 17, 2025

### Changes
- Added missing `VestingCreated` event to `pallet-vesting`
- The event was already documented in the pallet but not actually implemented
- Emits event on `vested_transfer` and `force_vested_transfer` calls
- Includes tests to verify event emission
- PRDoc indicates a major version bump for `pallet-vesting`

### Affected Crates
- `pallet-vesting`: major bump
- `pallet-staking`: none (minor comment expansion)

## Impact Assessment: INHERITED

### Analysis

**Moonbeam does not use `pallet-vesting`:**

1. **Runtime Configuration:** None of the moonbeam runtimes (moonbase, moonbeam, moonriver) include `pallet-vesting` in their `construct_runtime!` macro.

2. **Direct Dependencies:** No `pallet-vesting` dependency exists in any Cargo.toml files:
   - `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/Cargo.toml`
   - `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/*/Cargo.toml`
   - `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/pallets/*/Cargo.toml`

3. **Code References:** No references to `pallet_vesting`, `VestingCreated`, `vested_transfer`, or `force_vested_transfer` found in the codebase.

4. **Transitive Dependency:** `pallet-vesting` appears only in `Cargo.lock` as a transitive dependency, meaning it's pulled in by another polkadot-sdk crate but not actively used by moonbeam.

**Note on Vesting-Related Configuration:**

The grep results showed `VestingBlockNumber` and `VestingBlockProvider` configuration in the runtime files, but these are associated types for `pallet_crowdloan_rewards::Config`, not `pallet-vesting`. This is a different pallet with its own vesting logic for crowdloan rewards.

### Required Actions

**None.** This change will be inherited automatically through the polkadot-sdk dependency update without requiring any code changes in moonbeam.

### Testing Recommendations

No specific testing required. Standard regression testing during the polkadot-sdk upgrade should be sufficient.
