# PR #8212: [pallet-revive] fix bn128 benchmark

**Sentiment: NOT APPLICABLE**

## Overview

- **Title**: [pallet-revive] fix bn128 benchmark
- **Audience**: Runtime Dev
- **Crate**: pallet-revive (patch bump)
- **PR**: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8212
- **Status**: Merged (April 10, 2025)

## Summary

This PR updates the BN128 (Barreto-Naehrig 128-bit) benchmark measurements for the `pallet-revive` module, specifically correcting the `bn128_pairing` function benchmark parameters.

## Key Changes

- Updated benchmark weights for `bn128_pairing` operation
- Corrected measurement: Old 12.66ms â†’ New 8.50s (+67037.59% change)
- The dramatic increase reflects corrected benchmark parameters that more accurately represent actual execution costs
- Affects gas fee calculations for BN128 pairing operations in smart contract execution

## Impact on Moonbeam

**No impact** - Moonbeam does not use `pallet-revive`.

### Analysis

Moonbeam uses `pallet-evm` (Frontier) for Ethereum compatibility and smart contract execution, not `pallet-revive`. A search of the Moonbeam codebase confirms:

- No `pallet-revive` dependencies in Cargo.toml files
- No `pallet-revive` usage in any runtime configurations
- No references to `pallet-revive` in runtime code

`pallet-revive` is a newer smart contract pallet (successor to `pallet-contracts` with EVM compatibility features) that Moonbeam has not adopted.

## Required Actions

**None** - This change is not applicable to Moonbeam's architecture.

## Technical Details

The PR fixes benchmark weights for cryptographic operations in pallet-revive. While this is important for chains using pallet-revive to ensure correct gas fee calculations, it has no bearing on Moonbeam's EVM implementation through Frontier.
