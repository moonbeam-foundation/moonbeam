# PR #8271: Snowbridge - Message Reward Topups

## Overview

**Status**: Merged (May 15, 2025)
**Author**: Clara van Staden (@claravanstaden)
**Labels**: T15-bridges
**GitHub**: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8271

## Summary

This PR introduces the ability to add tips (reward topups) to Snowbridge Inbound and Outbound messages when relayer rewards are insufficient to incentivize message processing. This feature allows users to increase the economic incentive for relayers to process their bridge messages.

## Technical Changes

### Modified Crates

| Crate | Bump | Impact |
|-------|------|--------|
| snowbridge-pallet-inbound-queue-v2 | minor | New tipping functionality for inbound messages |
| snowbridge-pallet-outbound-queue-v2 | minor | New tipping functionality for outbound messages |
| snowbridge-pallet-system-frontend | major | Adds `add_tip` extrinsic |
| snowbridge-pallet-system-v2 | major | Tip processing and storage logic |
| snowbridge-core | minor | Core types and traits for tipping |
| snowbridge-test-utils | minor | Test utilities updated |
| bridge-hub-westend-runtime | minor | Runtime integration |
| asset-hub-westend-runtime | minor | Runtime integration |

### Key Implementation Details

1. **EthereumSystemFrontend Pallet**
   - Adds `add_tip` extrinsic allowing users to attach tips in any asset
   - Assets are automatically swapped for ether (if needed) and burned
   - Sends XCM message to Bridge Hub with tip information

2. **EthereumSystemV2 Pallet**
   - Receives and processes tips from frontend pallet
   - Applies tips to relayer rewards when processing messages
   - Introduces `LostTips` storage for tips added after message processing (for future refund recovery)

3. **Message Flow**
   - User submits message with insufficient reward
   - User calls `add_tip` with additional reward
   - Tip is added to message reward pool
   - Relayer processes message with increased reward

## Impact on Moonbeam

### Direct Impact: **NONE**

Moonbeam does not directly use Snowbridge pallets. This functionality is specific to:
- Bridge Hub parachains (Westend, Polkadot, Kusama)
- Asset Hub parachains that interact with Ethereum via Snowbridge

### Indirect Impact: **MINIMAL**

**Dependency Analysis:**
```
moonbeam-runtime -> bridge-hub-common -> snowbridge-core (v0.13.2)
moonriver-runtime -> bridge-hub-common -> snowbridge-core (v0.13.2)
```

- `snowbridge-core` is a transitive dependency through `bridge-hub-common`
- Current version in Moonbeam: 0.13.2 (from stable2503 branch)
- This PR affects version 0.14.0+ in stable2506
- Moonbeam does not use Snowbridge-specific functionality directly

## Sentiment Analysis

### Overall Sentiment: **NEUTRAL TO SLIGHTLY POSITIVE** ⚪

#### Positive Aspects ✅
1. **Improved Bridge Reliability**: Addresses real-world issue where relayer rewards become unprofitable
2. **User Empowerment**: Allows users to self-service when messages are stuck
3. **Flexible Design**: Supports tipping in any asset with automatic conversion
4. **Well-Reviewed**: 3 approvals from core bridge team members
5. **Comprehensive**: 59 commits with thorough testing and benchmarks

#### Neutral Aspects ⚪
1. **Not Applicable to Moonbeam**: Snowbridge is not part of Moonbeam's bridge strategy
2. **Ecosystem Enhancement**: Improves Polkadot<>Ethereum bridging infrastructure that Moonbeam doesn't directly use
3. **Dependency Update**: Minor version bump in transitive dependency (snowbridge-core)

#### Concerns/Questions ⚠️
1. **LostTips Storage Design**: Reviewer raised concerns about storing lost tips rather than implementing XCM-based refunds
   - Current design stores tips that arrive after message processing
   - Alternative approach suggested: return tips to sender via XCM
   - Design decision deferred pending broader review from Parity
2. **Major Version Bumps**: Two pallets received major version bumps, indicating potential breaking changes
3. **Future Technical Debt**: The `LostTips` mechanism may need refactoring in future releases

## Migration Requirements

**None for Moonbeam** - This PR does not affect Moonbeam's runtime or functionality.

## Testing & Quality

- **59 commits** implementing feature across multiple pallets
- Integration tests added for Bridge Hub Westend
- Benchmarks updated for performance validation
- Thoroughly reviewed by bridge team experts

## Recommendation

**Action Required**: NONE

**Rationale**:
- Snowbridge is not part of Moonbeam's architecture
- Changes are isolated to bridge-specific pallets
- Transitive dependency update (snowbridge-core) is minor and non-breaking
- No runtime migrations needed
- No testing required for Moonbeam

**Monitoring**:
- Track future Snowbridge developments in case Moonbeam considers Ethereum bridging integration
- Monitor for any changes to `bridge-hub-common` that might affect XCM functionality used by Moonbeam

## References

- **Issue**: SNO-1353
- **PRDoc**: `/Users/manuelmauro/.substrate-mcp/moonbeam/releases/stable2506/pr-docs/pr_8271.prdoc`
- **Commits**: 59 commits across Snowbridge pallets
- **Reviewers**: @acatangiu, @franciscoaguirre, @vgeddes

## Conclusion

This PR enhances Snowbridge's economic incentive model for relayers but has **no direct impact on Moonbeam**. The changes are well-implemented and address a real operational challenge in bridge message processing. For Moonbeam, this is purely informational with no action required for the stable2506 upgrade.
