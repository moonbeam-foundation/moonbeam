# PR #8273: pallet-revive: Add net-listening rpc

**Sentiment: INHERITED**

## Overview

- **PR**: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8273
- **Status**: Merged (April 29, 2025)
- **Author**: pgherveou
- **Crates**: `pallet-revive-eth-rpc` (patch bump)
- **Audience**: Runtime Dev

## Summary

This PR adds the `net_listening` JSON-RPC method to `pallet-revive-eth-rpc`. The `net_listening` endpoint is part of the Ethereum JSON-RPC specification and returns whether the client is actively listening for network connections. While not strictly required, this method is used by some wallets like SubWallet for compatibility checking.

## Changes

The PR implements the standard Ethereum `net_listening` RPC method for pallet-revive's Ethereum RPC compatibility layer. The implementation involved:

- Addition of the `net_listening` RPC method
- Receipt provider refactoring
- Gas price runtime fetching improvements
- Caching mechanism updates
- Encoding length fixes
- Linting and formatting corrections

## Impact on Moonbeam

**Sentiment: INHERITED**

### Analysis

1. **No Direct Impact**: Moonbeam does not use `pallet-revive` or `pallet-revive-eth-rpc`. Moonbeam's EVM implementation is based on Frontier's `pallet-evm` and its own custom precompiles.

2. **pallet-revive vs pallet-evm**: `pallet-revive` appears to be a different smart contract pallet (likely for PolkaVM-based contracts or an alternative EVM implementation) that is not part of Moonbeam's architecture.

3. **No Action Required**: Since Moonbeam doesn't use this pallet, no code changes, testing, or migration work is needed.

4. **Dependency Update Only**: This change will be inherited as part of the Polkadot SDK dependency update but will not affect Moonbeam's runtime or RPC layer.

### Verification

Searched Moonbeam codebase for `pallet-revive` usage:
- No references found in runtime `Cargo.toml` files
- No usage in any runtime code
- Only mentions are in other upgrade analysis documents

## Recommendation

**INHERITED** - No action required. This change can be safely inherited as part of the Polkadot SDK dependency update without any modifications to Moonbeam.
