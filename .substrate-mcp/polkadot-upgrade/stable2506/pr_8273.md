# PR #8273 Analysis: pallet-revive: Add net-listening rpc

## Overview
- **PR Title**: pallet-revive: Add net-listening rpc
- **PR URL**: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8273
- **Audience**: Runtime Dev
- **Crates Modified**: pallet-revive-eth-rpc (patch bump)

## Summary
This PR adds the `net_listening` JSON-RPC method to pallet-revive-eth-rpc. This method is part of the standard Ethereum JSON-RPC API and reports whether a node is actively listening for network connections. While not strictly required for core functionality, it is used by some wallets like SubWallet for compatibility checks.

## Changes
- Added `net_listening` RPC endpoint to pallet-revive-eth-rpc
- This is an additive, non-breaking change that improves Ethereum API compatibility for pallet-revive

## Impact on Moonbeam: INHERITED

**Impact Level**: INHERITED

**Rationale**: This PR has NO direct impact on Moonbeam because:

1. **Different Smart Contract System**: This PR modifies `pallet-revive-eth-rpc`, which is part of the pallet-revive smart contract system. Pallet-revive is Polkadot SDK's WASM-based smart contract platform (successor to pallet-contracts).

2. **Moonbeam Uses Frontier EVM**: Moonbeam uses `pallet-evm` from the Frontier project for Ethereum compatibility, not pallet-revive. This was confirmed by checking the runtime dependencies:
   - No references to `pallet-revive` or `pallet-revive-eth-rpc` in Moonbeam's Cargo.toml files
   - Runtime uses `pallet-evm` and various `pallet-evm-precompile-*` crates instead

3. **No Codebase References**: Search of the Moonbeam codebase found no references to:
   - `pallet-revive`
   - `pallet_revive`
   - `net_listening` RPC implementation

## Verification

```bash
# Confirmed pallet-revive is not used in any runtime
rg "pallet-revive" runtime/moonbase/Cargo.toml runtime/moonbeam/Cargo.toml runtime/moonriver/Cargo.toml
# No results

# Confirmed Moonbeam uses pallet-evm instead
rg "pallet-evm" runtime/moonbase/Cargo.toml | head -5
# Shows multiple pallet-evm-* dependencies
```

## Action Required
None. This change will be inherited as part of the Polkadot SDK dependency update but does not require any changes to Moonbeam's codebase.

## Notes
- Pallet-revive and pallet-evm are two completely different smart contract execution environments
- Moonbeam's Ethereum compatibility comes from Frontier (pallet-evm), not pallet-revive
- This PR only affects projects using pallet-revive for smart contracts
