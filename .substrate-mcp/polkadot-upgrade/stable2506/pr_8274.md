# PR #8274 Analysis: Add get_storage_var_key for variable-sized keys

## Overview

**PR:** [#8274 - pallet-revive: add get_storage_var_key for variable-sized keys](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8274)
**Status:** Merged (April 23, 2025)
**Release:** stable2506
**Audience:** Runtime Developers

## Summary

This PR adds a new runtime API call `get_storage_var_key` to `pallet-revive` to support variable-sized storage keys. The existing `get_storage` function only handled fixed 32-byte keys, but ink!v6 still uses variable-sized keys with a different hashing mechanism.

## Changes

### New Runtime API

- **Added:** `get_storage_var_key` to `pallet_revive::ReviveApi` trait
- **Purpose:** Handle variable-sized storage keys for smart contracts
- **Rationale:** While the underlying storage access already supported both key types, this exposes that functionality via a dedicated runtime API call

### Affected Crates

- `pallet-revive`: **major** bump
- `asset-hub-westend-runtime`: **minor** bump
- `kitchensink-runtime`: **minor** bump

## Technical Details

### Design Decision

The author considered modifying the existing `get_storage` function to accept both key types but opted for a separate function based on community discussion. This maintains cleaner API separation between fixed-size and variable-size key handling.

### API Surface

```rust
// New API call in pallet_revive::ReviveApi
fn get_storage_var_key(...) -> ...
```

Implementation teams need only relay the call to the existing low-level storage access functionality.

## Impact on Moonbeam

### Assessment: NO IMPACT

**Reason:** Moonbeam does not use `pallet-revive`.

#### Analysis

1. **Architecture Difference:**
   - `pallet-revive` is designed for WASM-based smart contracts (successor to `pallet-contracts`)
   - Moonbeam uses `pallet-evm` for Ethereum-compatible smart contracts
   - These are completely separate smart contract execution environments

2. **Dependency Check:**
   - Verified that `pallet-revive` is not included in any Moonbeam runtime dependencies
   - No `ReviveApi` trait implementations found in the Moonbeam codebase
   - All smart contract functionality in Moonbeam is handled through EVM precompiles and `pallet-evm`

3. **Runtime APIs:**
   - Moonbeam's runtime APIs are focused on Ethereum compatibility (EVM tracing, eth RPC, etc.)
   - This change only affects chains that implement WASM contract execution via `pallet-revive`

## Migration Required

**None** - This PR does not affect Moonbeam.

## Action Items

- [ ] No action required for Moonbeam
- [ ] This PR can be safely ignored during the stable2506 upgrade process

- **GitHub PR:** https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8274
- **Related:** This is part of the ongoing development of `pallet-revive` as the next-generation WASM smart contract pallet

## Conclusion

PR #8274 introduces a new runtime API for variable-sized storage keys in `pallet-revive`. Since Moonbeam uses EVM-based smart contracts via `pallet-evm` and does not use `pallet-revive`, this change has no impact on the Moonbeam codebase. No migration, code changes, or testing is required for this PR during the stable2506 upgrade.

**Risk Level:** None
**Effort Required:** None
**Priority:** N/A
