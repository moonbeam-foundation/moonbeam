# PR #8337: Add staking/election related view functions

## Overview
- **PR**: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8337
- **Title**: Add staking/election related view functions
- **Audience**: Runtime Dev
- **Status**: Merged on May 2, 2025

## Summary
This PR adds view functions to staking and election-related pallets to support wallet operations and staking miner functionality:
- **Wallet use case**: Enable wallets to determine rebag operation requirements
- **Staking miner use case**: Allow miners to calculate required deposit amounts in advance

## Changes Made
The PR introduces new view functions to the following pallets:
- `pallet-bags-list` (minor version bump)
- `pallet-election-provider-multi-block` (minor version bump)

## Impact Assessment for Moonbeam

### No Impact - Pallets Not Used

**Conclusion**: This PR has **NO IMPACT** on Moonbeam.

**Rationale**:
1. Moonbeam does not use `pallet-bags-list` in any runtime
2. Moonbeam does not use `pallet-election-provider-multi-block` in any runtime
3. Moonbeam uses its own custom staking implementation: `pallet-parachain-staking`
4. These pallets are not listed as dependencies in Moonbeam's Cargo.toml

### Verification
Confirmed by examining all three Moonbeam runtimes:
- **moonbase** (`/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonbase/src/lib.rs`)
- **moonbeam** (`/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonbeam/src/lib.rs`)
- **moonriver** (`/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonriver/src/lib.rs`)

All three runtimes include `ParachainStaking: pallet_parachain_staking` in their `construct_runtime!` macro, but none include `pallet-bags-list` or `pallet-election-provider-multi-block`.

## Action Items
- **No action required**

## Notes
- This PR is specific to Substrate's standard staking mechanism and election provider system
- Moonbeam's parachain-based staking model is architecturally different and doesn't rely on these pallets
- The changes are additive (new view functions) with no breaking changes to existing APIs
