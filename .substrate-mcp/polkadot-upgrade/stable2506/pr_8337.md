# PR #8337: add staking/election related view functions

**Impact**: INHERITED
**Confidence**: High
**Affected Components**: None

## Changes Detected

This PR adds two new view functions to staking and election-related pallets in Polkadot SDK:

1. **pallet-bags-list**: Added view function to help wallets perform rebag operations
2. **pallet-election-provider-multi-block**: Added view function to help staking miners determine required deposit amounts in advance

Both changes are additive (new functions only) with minor version bumps, indicating no breaking changes to existing functionality.

**PR Details:**
- GitHub: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8337
- Related Issue: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-staking-miner/issues/1030
- Audience: Runtime Dev
- Labels: T2-pallets

## Project Impact

**No impact on Moonbeam.**

Moonbeam does not use the affected pallets:
- `pallet-bags-list` - NOT used in any Moonbeam runtime
- `pallet-election-provider-multi-block` - NOT used in any Moonbeam runtime

Moonbeam uses its own custom staking implementation (`pallet-parachain-staking`) instead of the standard Substrate staking/election pallets. The three runtimes (moonbase, moonriver, moonbeam) all use this custom pallet.

**Staking Architecture:**
- Moonbeam: `pallet_parachain_staking` (custom implementation)
- NOT using: `pallet_staking`, `pallet_bags_list`, or `pallet_election_provider_multi_block`

## Evidence & References

### Runtime Pallet Analysis

All three Moonbeam runtimes (moonbase, moonriver, moonbeam) use the same staking architecture:

```rust
// From runtime/moonbase/src/lib.rs (and similar in moonriver/moonbeam)
construct_runtime! {
    pub enum Runtime {
        // ... other pallets ...
        ParachainStaking: pallet_parachain_staking::{Pallet, Call, Storage, Event<T>, Config<T>} = 12,
        // ... other pallets ...
    }
}
```

### Codebase Search Results

**Search for pallet-bags-list:**
```
$ rg "pallet-bags-list|pallet_bags_list|BagsList" /Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam
/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/Cargo.lock
9367:name = "pallet-bags-list"
```
Result: Only appears as transitive dependency in Cargo.lock, not used in any source code.

**Search for BagsList in runtimes:**
```
$ rg "BagsList|bags.?list" /Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/*/src/lib.rs
```
Result: No matches found.

**Search for ElectionProvider:**
```
$ rg "ElectionProvider|election.?provider.?multi" /Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/*/src/lib.rs
```
Result: No matches found.

**Search for pallet-election-provider-multi-block:**
```
$ rg "pallet-election-provider-multi-block|pallet_election_provider_multi_block|ElectionProviderMultiBlock" /Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam
```
Result: No files found.

### Dependency Analysis

The `pallet-bags-list` appears in `Cargo.lock` as a transitive dependency (likely pulled in by `polkadot-sdk` dependencies), but is not explicitly used or configured in any Moonbeam runtime.

**Cargo.lock entry:**
```toml
name = "pallet-bags-list"
version = "40.0.0"
source = "git+https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/polkadot-sdk?branch=moonbeam-polkadot-stable2506#c5698d1a20558313657b45fc56dc1582772e2d1d"
```

## Conclusion

This PR has **no impact** on Moonbeam. The changes are purely additive (new view functions) to pallets that Moonbeam does not use. The update will be inherited automatically through the Polkadot SDK dependency upgrade without requiring any code changes or attention from the Moonbeam team.

**Action Required**: None
