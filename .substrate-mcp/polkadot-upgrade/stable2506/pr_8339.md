# PR #8339: Add election-provider-multi-block::minimum-score to genesis config

## Overview

**PR Title:** [AHM] add election-provider-multi-block::minimum-score to genesis config
**PR Number:** 8339
**Status:** Merged (May 1, 2025)
**Audience:** Runtime Dev
**Labels:** T2-pallets

## Summary

This PR adds the ability to set the genesis `minimumScore` parameter in the `pallet-election-provider-multi-block` pallet. This allows runtime developers to configure the minimum score threshold at chain genesis rather than only being able to set it through runtime upgrades or governance.

## Changes

**Affected Crates:**
- `pallet-election-provider-multi-block` (minor bump)

**Technical Details:**
- Adds `minimumScore` to the genesis configuration for `pallet-election-provider-multi-block`
- This parameter is used in multi-block election provider logic to set score thresholds
- Previously, this value could not be configured at genesis and would use default values

## Impact Assessment for Moonbeam

**Impact Level:** âšª **NONE**

### Analysis

Moonbeam **does not use** the `pallet-election-provider-multi-block` pallet. This has been verified by:

1. **Runtime Configuration:** No references to `pallet-election-provider-multi-block` or `ElectionProviderMultiBlock` found in any runtime configuration
2. **Dependencies:** No election provider pallets in runtime Cargo.toml dependencies
3. **Architecture:** As a parachain, Moonbeam relies on the relay chain (Polkadot/Kusama/Westend) for consensus and validator selection, making election provider pallets unnecessary

### Rationale

Election provider pallets are designed for chains that need to manage their own validator/authority selection process, such as:
- Relay chains (Polkadot, Kusama)
- Standalone chains with their own consensus mechanisms
- Solo chains using nominated proof-of-stake (NPoS)

Moonbeam, as a parachain focused on Ethereum compatibility:
- Inherits security and consensus from its relay chain
- Uses collator selection rather than validator elections
- Does not require election provider functionality

## Action Required

**None.** This PR can be safely ignored for the Moonbeam upgrade to stable2506.

## Verification

```bash
# Confirmed no usage in Moonbeam codebase
grep -r "election-provider-multi-block" runtime/
grep -r "ElectionProviderMultiBlock" runtime/
grep -r "pallet_election_provider" runtime/
# All searches returned no results
```

**Conclusion:** This PR introduces a genesis configuration option for a pallet that Moonbeam does not use. No action, code changes, or testing required for this change.
