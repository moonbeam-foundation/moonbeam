# PR #8339 Impact Analysis

## PR Overview

**Title:** [AHM] add election-provider-multi-block::minimum-score to genesis config

**GitHub:** https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8339

**Status:** Merged (May 1, 2025)

**Author:** kianenigma

**Audience:** Runtime Dev

## Summary

This PR adds the ability to configure the `minimumScore` parameter in the `pallet-election-provider-multi-block` genesis configuration. This provides greater flexibility in setting the minimum score threshold for election providers at chain initialization.

## Changes

### Crates Modified
- `pallet-election-provider-multi-block` (minor bump)

### What Changed
- Added genesis configuration option for `minimumScore` parameter in the election-provider-multi-block pallet
- Updated pallet configuration to allow this value to be set during genesis initialization
- Previously, this value could only be set after genesis through governance or runtime upgrades

## Impact on Moonbeam

**Impact Level:** NONE

**Rationale:**

Moonbeam does not use the `pallet-election-provider-multi-block` pallet. Analysis of the Moonbeam codebase reveals:

1. **No dependency:** The pallet is not included in any runtime Cargo.toml files
2. **Not in runtime:** The `construct_runtime!` macro in all three runtimes (moonbeam, moonriver, moonbase) does not include this pallet
3. **Different staking model:** Moonbeam uses `pallet-parachain-staking` for its custom parachain collator selection, not the NPoS election system used by relay chains

### Why This Pallet Isn't Used

The `pallet-election-provider-multi-block` is designed for:
- Relay chain validator elections (Polkadot, Kusama)
- Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) election mechanisms
- Complex multi-block election processes

Moonbeam's architecture:
- Parachain-based (not a relay chain)
- Uses delegated proof-of-stake through `pallet-parachain-staking`
- Simpler collator selection mechanism
- No need for complex multi-block election processes

## Action Required

**None** - This PR has no effect on Moonbeam's functionality or configuration.

## Verification

Searched the entire Moonbeam codebase for:
- `election-provider-multi-block` - Found only in other PR analysis documents
- `ElectionProviderMultiBlock` - No results
- `pallet-election-provider` - No results in runtime dependencies

Verified against all runtime implementations:
- `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonbeam/src/lib.rs`
- `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonriver/src/lib.rs`
- `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonbase/src/lib.rs`

None contain this pallet.
