# PR #8339: [AHM] add election-provider-multi-block::minimum-score to genesis config

**Impact**: INHERITED
**Confidence**: High
**Affected Components**: None

## Changes Detected

This PR adds the ability to set the genesis `minimumScore` configuration parameter in the `pallet-election-provider-multi-block` pallet. This is a minor enhancement that allows runtime developers to configure the minimum score for elections during chain initialization.

Key changes:
- Added `minimum_score` field to genesis configuration
- Bump: minor version bump for `pallet-election-provider-multi-block`
- Audience: Runtime developers
- No breaking changes

## Project Impact

**No impact on Moonbeam.**

Moonbeam does not use `pallet-election-provider-multi-block` in any of its three runtimes (moonbase, moonriver, moonbeam). The project uses a custom staking implementation via `pallet-parachain-staking` for collator selection and rewards, which does not depend on Polkadot SDK's election provider pallets.

### Verification

Searched the entire codebase for any usage of election provider components:
- No references to `election-provider-multi-block`
- No references to `ElectionProviderMultiBlock`
- No references to `pallet_election` in any form

Confirmed by examining the runtime construction in `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonbase/src/lib.rs` (lines 1194-1254), which shows all included pallets. The election-provider-multi-block pallet is not present in:
- moonbase runtime
- moonriver runtime (by extension)
- moonbeam runtime (by extension)

Moonbeam uses:
- `ParachainStaking: pallet_parachain_staking` (index 12) for its custom staking mechanism
- Does not use any Substrate election provider pallets

## Evidence & References

1. **Runtime pallet list**: `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonbase/src/lib.rs:1194-1254`
   - Complete list of pallets in `construct_runtime!` macro
   - No election-provider-multi-block present

2. **Codebase search results**:
   - Pattern: `election.?provider.?multi.?block` - No matches
   - Pattern: `pallet-election-provider-multi-block` - No matches
   - Pattern: `ElectionProviderMultiBlock` - No matches
   - Pattern: `ElectionProvider` - No matches
   - Pattern: `pallet_election` - No matches

3. **Custom staking implementation**:
   - Moonbeam uses `pallet-parachain-staking` (custom pallet)
   - Located at: `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/pallets/parachain-staking/`
   - This pallet handles collator selection without election provider mechanisms

## Conclusion

This PR has **no impact** on Moonbeam. The changes are automatically inherited through the Polkadot SDK dependency update but require no code changes, testing, or migration work since the affected pallet is not used in the project.
