# PR #8370: fix(collator-protocol): address unneeded collator connection issue

**Impact**: INHERITED
**Confidence**: High
**Affected Components**: None (Moonbeam doesn't directly use this crate)

## Changes Detected

PR #8370 fixes an issue in the Polkadot collator protocol where collators continued attempting to connect to validators even after their core assignment was removed. This led to unnecessary network connections and log spam with messages like "An unneeded collator connected".

The fix adds a `has_assigned_cores()` function to verify core assignments on active relay chain leaves before attempting validator connections.

**Changed Crate:**
- `polkadot-collator-protocol` (patch bump to v24.0.0)

**Specific Changes:**
- Modified `polkadot/node/network/collator-protocol/src/collator_side/mod.rs`
- Added core assignment checking logic
- Added test case `connect_with_no_cores_assigned`

## Project Impact

**No direct impact on Moonbeam code.**

This change is purely internal to the Polkadot collator protocol networking layer. Moonbeam doesn't directly use or interact with `polkadot-collator-protocol` in its codebase.

**Moonbeam's Collator Architecture:**
- Uses Cumulus client libraries (`cumulus-client-collator`, `cumulus-client-service`)
- Uses Nimbus consensus (`nimbus-consensus`)
- The `polkadot-collator-protocol` crate is only included as a transitive dependency through Cumulus

**Benefits to Moonbeam:**
1. Reduced unnecessary network connections between collators and validators
2. Cleaner logs (no "unneeded collator connected" spam)
3. More efficient resource usage when core assignments change

This is a runtime improvement that Moonbeam will inherit automatically through the Polkadot SDK upgrade without requiring any code changes.

## Evidence & References

### Dependency Check
```
# Cargo.lock shows polkadot-collator-protocol is present but only as transitive dependency
/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/Cargo.lock:
  name = "polkadot-collator-protocol"
  version = "24.0.0"
  source = "git+https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/polkadot-sdk?branch=moonbeam-polkadot-stable2506#c5698d1a20558313657b45fc56dc1582772e2d1d"
```

### Codebase Search Results
- **No direct usage**: Searched for `polkadot-collator-protocol`, `CollatorProtocol`, `collator_protocol` across entire Moonbeam codebase
- **No imports**: No Rust files import or use this crate directly
- **Cumulus integration**: Moonbeam uses Cumulus abstractions (`CollatorService`, `OverseerHandle`, `RelayChainInterface`) which internally use the collator protocol

### Relevant Moonbeam Files (using Cumulus/collator APIs)
- `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/node/service/src/lib.rs`: Uses Cumulus collator services
  - Lines 28, 1015: `CollatorService::new()`
  - Lines 924-925: `relay_chain_interface.overseer_handle()`
  - Line 1056: `nimbus_consensus::collators::lookahead::run()`

### Audience
From PRDoc: `[Node Dev, Node Operator]`
- This is an infrastructure improvement
- Node operators will see cleaner logs
- No action required from Moonbeam team

## Conclusion

This PR fixes a networking inefficiency in the Polkadot collator protocol. Moonbeam will automatically benefit from this fix through the Polkadot SDK upgrade with no code changes required. The impact is purely positive - better resource utilization and cleaner logs.
