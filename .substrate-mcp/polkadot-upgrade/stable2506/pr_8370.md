# PR #8370: Fix Unneeded Collator Connection Issue

**PR Link:** https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8370
**Audiences:** Node Dev, Node Operator
**Crates:** `polkadot-collator-protocol` (patch bump)

## Summary

This PR fixes an issue where collators continued attempting to connect to validators even after their core assignment was removed, leading to unnecessary connections and log spam with the message "An unneeded collator connected".

## Technical Details

### Problem
The collator protocol was establishing connections to validators even when the parachain had no core assignments on active relay chain leaves. This resulted in:
- Wasteful resource usage (unnecessary network connections)
- Misleading error logs that created noise in monitoring systems
- Potential confusion for node operators

### Solution
The fix introduces a new function `has_assigned_cores()` in the collator protocol that checks whether the parachain has any core assignments across all active relay chain leaves before attempting to establish connections with validators.

**Key Change Location:**
- `polkadot/node/network/collator-protocol/src/collator_side/mod.rs`

The logic now ensures collators only connect to validators if there are cores assigned to the parachain.

### Testing
A new unit test `connect_with_no_cores_assigned` was added to validate the behavior when a collator attempts to connect but has no active core assignments, ensuring the connection is properly rejected.

## Impact on Moonbeam

### Relevance: HIGH

This change is highly relevant to Moonbeam as a parachain that operates collators.

### Benefits
1. **Reduced Log Spam**: Moonbeam collators will no longer generate "An unneeded collator connected" error messages when there are no core assignments
2. **Resource Optimization**: Eliminates unnecessary connection attempts, reducing network overhead
3. **Improved Monitoring**: Cleaner logs make it easier to identify genuine issues
4. **Better Validator Relations**: Reduces unnecessary load on validators from unneeded connection attempts

### Operational Impact
- **No Breaking Changes**: This is a patch-level fix with no API changes
- **No Action Required**: The fix is transparent to existing collator operations
- **Improved Behavior**: Collators will automatically behave more efficiently after the upgrade

## Required Actions

### For Moonbeam Team
- ✅ **No code changes required** - This is a transparent bug fix in the Polkadot SDK
- ✅ **No configuration changes needed**
- ℹ️ **Monitor logs post-upgrade** to confirm the "An unneeded collator connected" messages are eliminated

### Testing Recommendations
1. **Pre-Upgrade**: Check collator logs for frequency of "An unneeded collator connected" messages
2. **Post-Upgrade**: Verify the messages no longer appear
3. **Functional Testing**: Confirm collator connections work normally during core assignments
4. **Edge Case**: Test behavior during periods of no core assignments (if applicable to Moonbeam's operation)

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level: LOW**

- Patch-level change with focused scope
- Approved by multiple Polkadot SDK maintainers (alexggh, alindima, eskimor)
- Includes unit tests for the new logic
- Fixes existing problematic behavior rather than introducing new features

## Related Issues

- Polkadot SDK Issue #6733 (referenced in PR)

## Recommendation

**ACCEPT** - This is a beneficial bug fix that improves collator efficiency and reduces operational noise. No action required from Moonbeam team beyond the standard upgrade process.
