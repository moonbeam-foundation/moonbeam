# PR #8382: Add poke_deposit extrinsic to pallet-bounties

## Summary

This PR introduces a new `poke_deposit` extrinsic to `pallet-bounties` that allows re-adjustment of deposits made when creating bounties. The extrinsic can increase or decrease deposits, with calls being free when actual adjustments occur and paid when no changes are made.

## Impact Assessment: DON'T KNOW → INHERITED

**Reasoning:** Moonbeam does NOT use `pallet-bounties` in any of its three runtimes (moonbeam, moonriver, moonbase). The pallet is not present in the `construct_runtime!` macro of any runtime configuration.

Since this PR only affects `pallet-bounties` functionality and Moonbeam doesn't include this pallet, the changes are automatically inherited through the dependency update with no direct impact on Moonbeam's functionality.

## Changes Overview

### New Functionality
- **New extrinsic**: `poke_deposit(bounty_id: BountyIndex)` - Re-adjusts deposits for existing bounties
- **New event**: `DepositPoked { index: BountyIndex }` - Emitted when deposit adjustment occurs
- **Pricing model**:
  - Free when deposit changes are made
  - Paid when no deposit adjustment occurs

### Technical Details
- Uses saturating arithmetic for safe calculations
- Callable by anyone (permissionless)
- Benchmark results: ~309-314 microseconds execution time
- Comprehensive test coverage included

## Moonbeam Assessment

### Current Usage
- **Moonbeam runtime**: No bounties pallet ❌
- **Moonriver runtime**: No bounties pallet ❌
- **Moonbase runtime**: No bounties pallet ❌
- **Relay encoder**: No bounties references ❌

### Action Required
None. This change will be inherited automatically through the Polkadot SDK dependency update without any modifications needed to Moonbeam's codebase.
