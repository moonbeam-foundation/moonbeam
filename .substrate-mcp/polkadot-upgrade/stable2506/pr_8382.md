# PR #8382: add poke_deposit extrinsic to pallet-bounties

**Impact**: INHERITED
**Confidence**: High
**Affected Components**: None

## Changes Detected

PR #8382 adds a new `poke_deposit` extrinsic to `pallet-bounties`. This extrinsic allows re-adjusting deposits made when creating bounties, enabling both deposit increases and decreases. The feature was added as part of addressing deposit reconsideration for the Asset Hub migration.

Key technical changes:
- New `poke_deposit` extrinsic in pallet-bounties
- Added new event `DepositPoked`
- The extrinsic is "free" (no transaction fee) if the deposit is actually adjusted, otherwise it is "paid"
- Uses saturating math for deposit calculations

This is a **major version bump** for pallet-bounties according to the PR documentation.

## Project Impact

**No impact on Moonbeam.** The project does not use pallet-bounties in any of its three runtimes.

Verification:
- Checked `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonbeam/src/lib.rs` (lines 1404-1500): pallet-bounties not present in `construct_runtime!`
- Checked `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonriver/src/lib.rs` (lines 1409-1485): pallet-bounties not present in `construct_runtime!`
- Checked `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonbase/src/lib.rs` (lines 1410-1480): pallet-bounties not present in `construct_runtime!`

All three runtimes use pallet-treasury (present in all construct_runtime blocks), but not pallet-bounties. Since Moonbeam doesn't integrate the bounties pallet, this change will be inherited automatically without requiring any action.

## Evidence & References

### Codebase Search Results

Search for pallet-bounties usage:
```bash
rg "pallet.bounties|pallet_bounties" /Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam
```
Result: Only found in Cargo.lock (transitive dependency), not actively used in runtime configurations.

### Runtime Configurations

All three runtime `construct_runtime!` blocks were examined:
- **moonbeam**: `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonbeam/src/lib.rs:1404-1500`
- **moonriver**: `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonriver/src/lib.rs:1409-1485`
- **moonbase**: `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonbase/src/lib.rs:1410-1480`

None include pallet-bounties (or the older pallet name Bounties) in their pallet configuration.

### Related Components

Moonbeam uses:
- `pallet_treasury` - Present in all runtimes (index 80 for moonbeam/moonriver, index 17 for moonbase)
- Treasury council governance via `TreasuryCouncilCollective`

But does not use the bounties functionality that extends treasury capabilities.

## Conclusion

This PR has **no action items** for Moonbeam. The changes to pallet-bounties will be inherited as part of the Polkadot SDK upgrade but won't affect Moonbeam's runtime behavior since the pallet is not configured in any of the three runtimes.
