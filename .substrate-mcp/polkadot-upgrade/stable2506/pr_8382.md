# PR #8382 Impact Analysis: Add poke_deposit extrinsic to pallet-bounties

## PR Summary

**Title:** Add poke_deposit extrinsic to pallet-bounties

**GitHub URL:** https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8382

**Description:**
This PR introduces a new extrinsic `poke_deposit` to `pallet-bounties` that allows re-adjustment of deposits made when creating bounties. The functionality supports both deposit increases and decreases, emitting a `DepositPoked` event upon successful execution.

## Changes Overview

### Modified Crates
- `pallet-bounties` (major bump)
- `rococo-runtime` (major bump)

### Key Changes
1. New extrinsic `poke_deposit` added to pallet-bounties
2. New event `DepositPoked` emitted when deposit adjustments occur
3. Transaction fee structure: free when deposit adjustment happens, paid when no change occurs
4. Uses saturating arithmetic for deposit calculations to prevent overflow
5. Includes benchmarking and comprehensive test coverage

### Type of Change
Additive - new extrinsic added to existing pallet, no breaking changes to existing functionality

## Impact on Moonbeam

### Impact Level: NONE

**Rationale:**
After comprehensive analysis of all three Moonbeam runtime variants (moonbeam, moonriver, moonbase), `pallet-bounties` is **not configured** in any runtime.

### Evidence

1. **Runtime Configuration:**
   - Moonbeam runtime: Treasury pallet present (index 80), no Bounties pallet
   - Moonriver runtime: Treasury pallet present (index 80), no Bounties pallet
   - Moonbase runtime: Treasury pallet present (index 17), no Bounties pallet

2. **Source Files Checked:**
   - `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonbeam/src/lib.rs`
   - `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonriver/src/lib.rs`
   - `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonbase/src/lib.rs`

3. **Cargo Dependencies:**
   - While `pallet-bounties` appears in `Cargo.lock` as a transitive dependency, it is not directly used or configured in any Moonbeam runtime

### Action Required

**None.** This change can be safely ignored as it does not affect Moonbeam.

## Additional Notes

- Moonbeam includes `pallet-treasury` but does not use the companion `pallet-bounties` functionality
- The `poke_deposit` extrinsic is specific to bounties and has no impact on treasury operations
- No runtime migration, code changes, or testing required for Moonbeam

## Conclusion

PR #8382 has **zero impact** on Moonbeam. No action is required for this change.
