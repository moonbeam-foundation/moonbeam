# PR #8387 Analysis: Update tests-evm.yml

## Overview

**PR:** [#8387 - Update tests-evm.yml](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8387)
**Status:** Merged (April 30, 2025)
**PRDoc:** `/Users/manuelmauro/.substrate-mcp/moonbeam/releases/stable2506/pr-docs/pr_8387.prdoc`

## Summary

This PR updates the SHA reference for the EVM test suite in the Polkadot SDK's CI/CD infrastructure file `tests-evm.yml`. This is a maintenance update to keep the EVM testing infrastructure aligned with current dependencies or test suite versions.

## Changes

**Type:** Infrastructure/CI Update
**Scope:** Test Suite Reference Update
**Breaking Changes:** None
**Crates Modified:** None
**Label:** `no-crate-publish-required`, `T7-smart_contracts`

### Technical Details

- **Modified File:** `.github/workflows/tests-evm.yml` (or similar CI configuration)
- **Change:** Updated SHA reference for EVM test suite
- **Audience:** Runtime Developers
- **Testing:** Passed 245 of 250 checks in Polkadot SDK CI/CD pipeline

## Impact Assessment for Moonbeam

### Impact Level: **INHERITED**

**Rationale:**

1. **No Direct Impact on Moonbeam Codebase**
   - This PR only updates CI infrastructure in the Polkadot SDK repository
   - No runtime code changes
   - No API changes
   - No dependency version changes

2. **Different EVM Implementation**
   - Moonbeam uses **Frontier** (via `moonbeam-foundation/frontier` fork) for EVM functionality
   - The Polkadot SDK's EVM test suite is likely related to **pallet-revive** (their new EVM-compatible contracts pallet)
   - Moonbeam does not use pallet-revive

3. **Separate Testing Infrastructure**
   - Moonbeam has its own comprehensive EVM testing:
     - Moonwall framework for integration tests
     - TypeScript test suites in `/test` directory
     - Runtime unit tests with EVM tracing
     - Custom CI workflows in `.github/workflows/build.yml`
   - Moonbeam does not depend on Polkadot SDK's `tests-evm.yml` workflow

4. **Frontier Dependency**
   - Moonbeam's EVM stack:
     ```toml
     pallet-ethereum = { git = "https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/frontier", branch = "moonbeam-polkadot-stable2503" }
     pallet-evm = { git = "https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/frontier", branch = "moonbeam-polkadot-stable2503" }
     ```
   - Frontier is a separate project from Polkadot SDK's pallet-revive
   - Changes to pallet-revive testing do not affect Frontier

## Verification

### Search Results

1. **No `tests-evm.yml` in Moonbeam:**
   ```bash
   # No results for "tests-evm" in Moonbeam codebase
   ```

2. **Moonbeam's EVM Testing:**
   - Located in: `/test/suites/dev/moonbase/`
   - Uses: Moonwall testing framework
   - Types: Dev tests, smoke tests, tracing tests, lazy loading tests

3. **CI Workflow Analysis:**
   - Moonbeam workflows: `.github/workflows/build.yml`, `.github/workflows/coverage.yml`
   - No references to Polkadot SDK's EVM test suite
   - Independent testing pipeline

## Recommendations

### Action Required: **NONE**

**Justification:**
- This is purely a CI infrastructure update in the upstream Polkadot SDK
- Does not affect any crates or runtime code
- Moonbeam uses Frontier (not pallet-revive) for EVM functionality
- Moonbeam has independent EVM testing infrastructure
- No changes needed to Moonbeam's codebase or CI workflows

### Monitoring

While no action is required, consider:
- If upgrading to a new Polkadot SDK version that includes pallet-revive changes, review those separately
- Continue monitoring Frontier updates from `moonbeam-foundation/frontier` repository
- Maintain current EVM testing infrastructure (Moonwall, TypeScript tests)

## Related Components

**Moonbeam Components Not Affected:**
- `pallet-evm` (from Frontier)
- `pallet-ethereum` (from Frontier)
- `pallet-evm-chain-id` (from Frontier)
- Custom EVM precompiles (`/precompiles/*`)
- EVM tracing functionality (`/client/evm-tracing`)
- Ethereum-XCM bridge (`pallets/ethereum-xcm`)

**Polkadot SDK Components:**
- `pallet-revive` (Polkadot SDK's new EVM contracts pallet - not used by Moonbeam)
- CI/CD workflows in Polkadot SDK repository

## Conclusion

**Sentiment: INHERITED**

This PR represents an internal CI/CD maintenance update in the Polkadot SDK repository that does not affect Moonbeam's codebase, functionality, or testing infrastructure. Moonbeam uses a different EVM implementation (Frontier) and maintains its own testing suite.

**Action Items:**
- None required
- Update tracking status to "Analyzed - No Impact"

## Additional Context

### EVM in Polkadot Ecosystem

1. **Frontier** (used by Moonbeam):
   - Mature EVM implementation
   - Used by Moonbeam, Astar, and other parachains
   - Separate from Polkadot SDK core

2. **pallet-revive** (Polkadot SDK):
   - New EVM-compatible contracts pallet
   - Still in development
   - Not adopted by Moonbeam

### Testing Strategy

Moonbeam's EVM testing remains robust with:
- 4-shard parallel dev tests
- Tracing tests with substitute runtimes
- Chopsticks upgrade tests
- Zombie network tests
- Bridge integration tests

No changes to this testing strategy are needed based on PR #8387.
