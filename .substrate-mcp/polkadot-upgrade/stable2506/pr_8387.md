- Status: Merged on April 30, 2025

## Project Impact

**No action required for Moonbeam.**

This PR only affects the Polkadot SDK's internal testing infrastructure and does not modify any runtime code, pallet-evm functionality, or client components. The changes are limited to CI configuration for the upstream repository's EVM test suite.

### Analysis Details:

1. **No Runtime Changes**: The PR does not modify any crates (`crates: []` in prdoc), meaning no runtime or client code was changed.

2. **No Moonbeam CI Impact**: Moonbeam maintains its own CI/CD workflows in `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/.github/workflows/` and does not reference or depend on Polkadot SDK's `tests-evm.yml`.

3. **No Code Dependencies**: Search of the Moonbeam codebase revealed:
   - No references to `tests-evm` or `evm-test` suite
   - No dependencies on Polkadot SDK's EVM testing infrastructure
   - Moonbeam uses its own TypeScript-based integration test suite via Moonwall

## Evidence & References

### Codebase Search Results:

```bash
# Search for references to Polkadot SDK EVM test suite
grep -r "tests-evm" /Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam
# Result: No matches found

grep -r "evm-test" /Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam
# Result: No matches found

grep -ri "evm.*test.*suite" /Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam
# Result: No matches found
```

### Moonbeam's Testing Infrastructure:

Moonbeam maintains its own independent testing setup:
- **Rust Tests**: `cargo test` for pallet unit tests
- **TypeScript Integration Tests**: Located in `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/test/` using Moonwall framework
- **CI Workflows**: Custom GitHub Actions in `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/.github/workflows/`

### Conclusion:

This PR is a maintenance update to the Polkadot SDK's upstream testing infrastructure. The changes are automatically inherited as part of the stable2506 upgrade but have zero impact on Moonbeam's functionality, testing, or codebase. No code changes, configuration updates, or testing adjustments are needed.
