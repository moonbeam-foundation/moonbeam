# PR #8441 Impact Analysis: Update prdoc in 8327 to fix release issue

## Overview

**PR Title**: Add all touched crates in #8327 to prdoc to fix release issue
**PR Link**: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8327
**Audience**: Node Operator
**Status**: Merged
**Label**: R0-no-crate-publish-required

## Summary of Changes

This PR is a **documentation-only fix** that corrects an incomplete prdoc file from PR #8327. It does not contain any code changes - only updates to release documentation.

### Changes Made:

1. **Updated prdoc/pr_8327.prdoc** - Added 6 missing crate entries:
   - `sp-metadata-ir` (bump: major)
   - `pallet-example-view-functions` (bump: major)
   - `frame-support` (bump: major)
   - `frame-support-procedural` (bump: major)
   - `frame-support-test` (bump: major)
   - `sp-api-proc-macro` (bump: major)

2. **Created prdoc/pr_8441.prdoc** - Self-documenting prdoc with empty crates array

### Purpose:
The PR fixed a release management issue by ensuring all crates touched in PR #8327 were properly documented for the release process. The label "R0-no-crate-publish-required" confirms this was purely administrative.

## Impact on Moonbeam

**No direct impact** - This PR contains zero code changes. It only updates release documentation (prdoc files) to ensure proper release management.

### Dependency Impact: NONE

The crates listed in this PR are the same as those already documented in PR #8327:
- All are transitive dependencies through polkadot-sdk workspace
- Version bumps are already covered by PR #8327 analysis (see `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/.substrate-mcp/polkadot-upgrade/stable2506/pr_8327.md`)

### Build/Test Impact: NONE

Since no code was changed, there are:
- No compilation changes
- No test updates required
- No runtime behavior changes

## Relationship to PR #8327

## Risk Assessment

**Overall Risk**: ZERO

- Documentation-only change
- No code modifications
- No dependency version changes beyond PR #8327
- No impact on moonbeam codebase
- No testing required

## Recommendations

1. **No action required** - This PR can be safely ignored from an implementation perspective
2. **Reference PR #8327** for actual upgrade impact and required actions
3. **Release notes**: This PR's changes are already captured in PR #8327 analysis

## Additional Context

**Why this PR exists:**
The original PR #8327 had an incomplete prdoc that didn't list all modified crates. This caused issues in the release tooling, which requires accurate crate lists for proper version management. PR #8441 corrected this by adding the missing entries.

**Verification:**
- Three reviewers (nkpar, pkhry, lexnv) approved the changes
- Successfully merged on May 6, 2025
- No crate publishing required (confirmed by R0 label)
