# PR #8448: Backport #8447 - Drop useless rep change

**Impact**: INHERITED
**Confidence**: High
**Affected Components**: Relay Chain Interface (Indirect)

## Changes Detected

PR #8448 is a backport of PR #8447 to the stable2503 branch, which removes an unnecessary reputation penalty in the Polkadot dispute distribution system. The specific change removes the `COST_APPARENT_FLOOD` reputation penalty that was applied when peers exceeded rate limits during dispute distribution.

### Code Changes
The change modified `polkadot/node/network/dispute-distribution/src/receiver/mod.rs`:

**Before:**
```rust
reputation_changes: vec![COST_APPARENT_FLOOD],
```

**After:**
```rust
reputation_changes: vec![],
```

The `COST_APPARENT_FLOOD` constant represented a reputation penalty for "Peer exceeded the rate limit". This was removed as it was deemed "not helping" with block time issues on Polkadot.

## Project Impact

This change has **INHERITED** impact on Moonbeam, meaning it will be automatically inherited through dependency updates without requiring any code changes in the Moonbeam codebase.

### Why This Affects Moonbeam

1. **Dependency Chain**: Moonbeam uses the dispute-distribution subsystem indirectly:
   - Moonbeam node service depends on `cumulus-relay-chain-inprocess-interface` and `cumulus-relay-chain-minimal-node`
   - These Cumulus crates depend on `polkadot-service`
   - `polkadot-service` includes `polkadot-dispute-distribution`

2. **Location in Codebase**:
   - `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/node/service/Cargo.toml` (lines 123-125)
   - `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/node/service/src/lib.rs` (lines 619-653: `build_relay_chain_interface` and relay chain startup)

3. **Operational Context**: The dispute distribution subsystem runs as part of the embedded relay chain node when Moonbeam collators connect to Polkadot/Kusama relay chains. This is used in parachain mode, not in dev mode.

### Expected Behavior Changes

**Positive**: The removal of this reputation penalty may improve network stability and reduce false positives where legitimate peers were being penalized during network congestion or high dispute activity. This aligns with the goal of addressing slow and inconsistent block times (#8414).

**No Action Required**: Moonbeam will automatically inherit this improvement when upgrading to stable2506. No code changes are needed in Moonbeam's codebase.

## Evidence & References

### From Cargo.lock
```
name = "polkadot-dispute-distribution"
version = "24.0.0"
source = "git+https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/polkadot-sdk?branch=moonbeam-polkadot-stable2506#4f1bceaa..."
```

The dispute-distribution crate is pulled in as a transitive dependency through the relay chain interface components used by Moonbeam collators.

### Related Issue Context
This change was made in response to issue #8414 about "Slow and Inconsistent Block Times" in Polkadot, which affected:
- Block time inconsistencies across parachains
- Many empty blocks on the relay chain
- Backing points down by ~15%
- "AuthorityFlooding" errors in validator logs

The reputation penalty removal is not the root cause fix but helps reduce unnecessary peer penalties that may contribute to network performance issues.

## Conclusion

This is a **network-level optimization** that Moonbeam inherits automatically. No code changes, testing, or migration work is required. The change should have a positive or neutral impact on Moonbeam's collator performance when interacting with Polkadot/Kusama relay chains.
