# PR #8470: Stabilize the FRAME Umbrella Crate

## Overview

**Status**: Merged (May 14, 2025)
**Impact Level**: Low - Documentation/API convenience improvement
**Breaking Changes**: None
**Migration Required**: No

## Summary

This PR removes the experimental status from the `polkadot-sdk-frame` umbrella crate after successful integration into 17 pallets in the Polkadot SDK. The umbrella crate provides a convenient single import point for all FRAME-related dependencies, offering an alternative to importing individual FRAME crates.

## What Changed

### Documentation & Status
- Removed experimental designation from the FRAME umbrella crate
- Enhanced documentation with clear usage guidelines
- Added comprehensive maintenance notes for future contributors
- Established design principles for prelude usage and module organization
- Updated documentation links to official hosted resources

### Crate Changes
- **polkadot-sdk-frame**: Status changed from experimental to stable (no version bump)
- **polkadot-sdk**: Documentation updates (no version bump)

## Technical Details

### Traditional FRAME Imports (Current Moonbeam Pattern)
```rust
use frame_support::{construct_runtime, parameter_types};
use frame_system::{self as system, Config as SystemConfig};
use frame_executive::Executive;
```

### FRAME Umbrella Crate Pattern (Now Stable)
```rust
use frame::prelude::*;
// or more specifically:
use frame::runtime::prelude::*;
use frame::pallet;
```

### What the Umbrella Crate Provides
The `polkadot-sdk-frame` crate re-exports commonly used items from:
- `frame-support`
- `frame-system`
- `frame-executive`
- `sp-runtime`
- `sp-core`
- Other FRAME-related primitives

This provides a simplified import experience, especially useful for new pallet development.

## Impact on Moonbeam

### Current Usage
- Moonbeam does **NOT** currently use the FRAME umbrella crate
- All pallets and runtime code use traditional individual FRAME imports
- The `polkadot-sdk-frame` crate appears in `Cargo.lock` only as a transitive dependency
- No changes to existing code are needed

### Analysis
```
Codebase scan results:
- polkadot-sdk-frame: Found only in Cargo.lock (transitive dependency)
- use frame::: No direct imports found
- Traditional FRAME imports: 1726 occurrences across 349 files
```

### Adoption Considerations

**Advantages of Adopting Umbrella Crate:**
- Simplified imports (single `use frame::prelude::*;` vs multiple individual imports)
- Potentially easier maintenance (fewer import statements to manage)
- Follows emerging Polkadot SDK best practices
- Now officially stable and supported

**Reasons to Keep Current Pattern:**
- Existing codebase is large and consistent with current pattern
- Individual imports provide better clarity about which crates are used
- No functional benefits, purely ergonomic
- Migration would touch many files with minimal value

**Recommendation:**
- **Short term**: No action required. This PR has no impact on Moonbeam's current functionality.
- **Long term**: Consider umbrella crate adoption for new pallets if the team finds the ergonomics appealing, but there's no urgency or requirement to migrate existing code.

## Migration Guide

N/A - No migration required. The traditional import pattern remains fully supported.

If adopting the umbrella crate in the future:

1. Add dependency to pallet's `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
frame = { workspace = true }
```

2. Replace individual imports:
```rust
// Before
use frame_support::{dispatch::DispatchResult, traits::Get};
use frame_system::Config as SystemConfig;

// After
use frame::prelude::*;
```

## Related PRs & Context

- **PR #6504**: Original tracking issue for FRAME umbrella crate integration
- **Integration**: Successfully integrated into 17 pallets as of May 9, 2025
- **Documentation**: Now points to official hosted docs

## Action Items

- [ ] None - Informational only

## Notes

- This is a quality-of-life improvement for pallet developers
- No breaking changes to existing APIs
- Both import patterns (individual and umbrella) remain fully supported
- The stabilization indicates the Polkadot SDK team's confidence in the umbrella crate design
- Moonbeam can continue using current patterns without any issues
