## PR Not Included in stable2506

This PR was merged into the **stable2412** branch, NOT stable2506. It is not part of the stable2506 release that Moonbeam is upgrading to.

## PR Details

- **Target Branch**: stable2412
- **Labels**: A3-backport, R0-no-crate-publish-required
- **Merged**: May 19, 2025 by EgorPopelyaev

## Changes Description

The PR adds scripts to revert changes made by the `parity-publish` tool during crates releases to align the state of stable branches with CI checks in the `checks-quick.yml` workflow.

Specific changes:
- Replace path dependencies with `workspace = true`
- Delete versions from root Cargo.toml
- Delete versions from umbrella/Cargo.toml

## Why This PR Is Not Relevant

1. **Wrong Branch**: This PR targets stable2412, while Moonbeam is upgrading to stable2506
2. **No prdoc in stable2506**: No `pr_8478.prdoc` file exists in `/Users/manuelmauro/.substrate-mcp/moonbeam/releases/stable2506/pr-docs/`
3. **Maintenance Only**: This is a CI/CD maintenance task that doesn't affect runtime or client functionality
4. **No Breaking Changes**: Even if it were included, it would be a build system change with no impact on parachain code

```bash
$ ls /Users/manuelmauro/.substrate-mcp/moonbeam/releases/stable2506/pr-docs/ | grep 8478
