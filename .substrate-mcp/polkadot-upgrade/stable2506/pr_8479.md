# PR #8479: Not a Pull Request

**Impact**: N/A - NOT A PR
**Confidence**: High
**Affected Components**: None

## Issue Overview

GitHub reference #8479 in the paritytech/polkadot-sdk repository is **not a Pull Request** but rather a **closed issue** titled "Bug in 2503: Invalid reported when not a terminal state".

## Issue Details

- **Type**: Bug report/issue
- **State**: CLOSED
- **Created**: 2025-05-09
- **Title**: Bug in 2503: Invalid reported when not a terminal state
- **Related to**: Transaction pool behavior in Polkadot SDK v2503

## Issue Description

The issue describes a bug in the transaction pool where invalid transactions are sometimes incorrectly reported as terminal states. This affects:

- Transaction submission and watching subscriptions
- Both `SingleState` and `ForkAware` transaction pool types
- Parachain transaction handling

### Key Technical Details:

1. **Single State Pool**: Transactions get marked as invalid (due to staleness) during block proposal but eventually get included in blocks and finalized. The premature "invalid" status causes client libraries (Polkadot.js API and PAPI) to incorrectly terminate subscriptions.

2. **Fork Aware Pool**: More severe issue where transactions marked invalid never get included in blocks and cause continuous logging errors.

## Impact on Moonbeam

**NONE** - This is not a PR and therefore has no direct code changes to analyze or integrate. The issue #8479 appears to be related to SDK v2503 behavior, and the current Moonbeam upgrade target is stable2506.

## Notes

While this issue discusses transaction pool behavior that could theoretically affect Moonbeam as a parachain, it's a bug report about SDK v2503 behavior rather than a code change in stable2506. Any fixes related to this issue would be tracked under separate PR numbers.
