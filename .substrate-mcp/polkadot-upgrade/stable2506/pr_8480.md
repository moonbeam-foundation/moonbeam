# PR #8480: NOT FOUND

**Impact**: N/A
**Confidence**: High
**Affected Components**: None

## Changes Detected

PR #8480 does not exist in the Polkadot SDK stable2506 release.

## Investigation Summary

After thorough investigation of the stable2506 release artifacts:

1. **PR Documentation Search**: The PR documentation file `/Users/manuelmauro/.substrate-mcp/moonbeam/releases/stable2506/pr-docs/pr_8480.prdoc` does not exist.

2. **Release Manifest Verification**: Examined the `pr_labels_mapping.json` file which contains all PRs included in stable2506. PR #8480 is not listed in this manifest.

3. **PR Number Range Analysis**:
   - The release includes 135 PR documentation files
   - In the 8470-8509 range, only the following PRs are present:
     - 8470
     - 8473
     - 8477
     - 8500
     - 8504
   - There is a gap between 8477 and 8500, confirming that 8480 was not included in this release

4. **GitHub API Check**: Attempted to verify the PR's existence in the polkadot-sdk repository but encountered API rate limits. However, the absence from all local release artifacts strongly indicates this PR either:
   - Does not exist in the polkadot-sdk repository
   - Was not merged into the stable2506 release branch
   - Was excluded from the release for some reason

## Project Impact

**No impact** - Since PR #8480 is not part of the stable2506 release, there are no changes to analyze or implement for the Moonbeam upgrade.

## Recommendation

1. The correct PR number (it may have been mistyped)

3. Whether this PR was merged to polkadot-sdk main but excluded from stable2506
