# PR #8513: [DNM] Reduce disable_validators_cache_size

**Impact**: INHERITED
**Confidence**: High
**Affected Components**: None (Relay Chain Only)

## Changes Detected

This PR modifies relay chain validator infrastructure:
- Reduced cache size for disabled validators
- Optimized statement distribution logic
- Improved dispute coordinator offchain processing
- Simplified reconstruction logic for validator sets

Key technical changes:
- Modified `disable_validators_cache_size` configuration
- Updated statement distribution to skip leafs where state cannot be fetched
- Extracted common functionality into single functions
- Optimized reconstruction to avoid processing all leafs unnecessarily

## Project Impact

**No impact on Moonbeam.** This PR affects relay chain validator node components that are not used by parachains.

### Evidence

1. **Moonbeam is a Parachain Collator**:
   - File: `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/node/Cargo.toml`
   - Line 4: `description = "Moonbeam Collator"`
   - Uses `cumulus-client-*` dependencies for parachain functionality

2. **No Dispute Coordinator Dependencies**:
   - Searched for `polkadot-dispute`, `DisputeCoordinator`, `disable_validators_cache`
   - No matches found in Moonbeam codebase
   - Only reference is in Cargo.lock (transitive dependency)

3. **No Statement Distribution Code**:
   - Parachain collators do not participate in relay chain statement distribution
   - This is relay chain validator-only functionality

4. **Parachain Architecture**:
   - Moonbeam uses cumulus-based collator services
   - Dependencies found in `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/node/service/Cargo.toml`:
     - `cumulus-client-cli`
     - `cumulus-client-collator`
     - `cumulus-client-consensus-common`
     - `cumulus-client-service`
     - `cumulus-client-parachain-inherent`

## Evidence & References

### Codebase Search Results

```bash
# No references to affected components:
grep -r "disable_validators_cache" → No results
grep -r "DisputeCoordinator" → No results
grep -ri "statement.*distribution" → Only Cargo.lock (transitive)
grep -r "polkadot-dispute" → Only Cargo.lock (transitive)
```

### Architecture Context

Moonbeam operates as a parachain collator, not a relay chain validator:
- **Collators** produce parachain blocks and submit them to relay chain validators
- **Validators** (relay chain only) validate parachain blocks, participate in disputes, and finalize blocks
- This PR optimizes relay chain validator internal operations that collators never execute

### PR Status

Note: This PR is marked "[DNM]" (Do Not Merge) and was closed without merging. It was an experimental optimization that may or may not be included in future releases.

## Recommendation

**No action required.** This change is transparent to parachain collators like Moonbeam. The optimizations improve relay chain validator performance and do not affect the parachain collator interface or behavior.

If this PR is eventually merged in a future release, it will still require no changes to Moonbeam's codebase as the improvements are entirely within relay chain validator infrastructure.
