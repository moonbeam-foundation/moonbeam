# PR #8533: fatxpool Add Fallback for Ready at Light

## Overview

**PR Title:** `fatxpool`: add fallback for ready at light
**GitHub:** https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8533
**Audience:** Node Dev
**Status:** Merged (May 22, 2025)
**Crate:** `sc-transaction-pool` (major bump)

## Summary

This PR enhances the fork-aware transaction pool (`fatxpool`) by adding a fallback mechanism for the `ready_at_light` function. When building blocks on fork parents where no suitable view exists in the transaction pool, the function now returns ready transactions from the most recent processed view instead of returning an empty set.

## Technical Details

### What `ready_at_light` Does

The `ready_at_light` function provides a lightweight alternative to the full transaction pool maintain procedure. It attempts to build a temporary view and return ready transactions for a specific block hash without executing new transaction validations. The process involves:
1. Finding a suitable base view for the requested block
2. Cloning that view
3. Pruning transactions already included in blocks between that view and the target block

### The Problem

Block producers building on fork parents could receive an empty ready transaction set from the pool when:
- The requested block hash is not on any known fork path that has a cached view
- No best block notification has been sent to the pool for that parent
- The block number cannot be resolved for the provided hash

This resulted in collators/validators missing available transactions when authoring blocks on non-canonical chains.

### The Solution

The PR implements a new fallback behavior:
- **Previous behavior:** Returned an empty iterator when no suitable view existed
- **New behavior:** Returns ready transactions from the most recent view in the pool

The fallback searches backwards through blocks toward finalization, collecting enacted blocks, until finding a view or reaching the finalized block height.

### Caveat

The fallback returns a "best-effort" ready transaction set that may potentially include:
- Some invalid transactions (for that specific block)
- Already-included transactions

However, this provides more practical results than returning nothing, as block authors can filter out invalid transactions during the proposal process.

### Code Changes

**Modified files:**
- `substrate/client/transaction-pool/src/fork_aware_txpool/fork_aware_txpool.rs`
- `substrate/client/transaction-pool/src/fork_aware_txpool/mod.rs`
- `substrate/client/transaction-pool/src/fork_aware_txpool/view_store.rs`
- `substrate/client/transaction-pool/tests/fatp.rs`

**Key additions:**
- Enhanced module documentation explaining fallback behavior
- New test coverage for the fallback mechanism
- Updated existing tests exercising `ready_at_light` functionality

## Impact on Moonbeam

### Current Usage

Moonbeam uses the standard `sc-transaction-pool` implementation without custom modifications:

1. **Direct Dependency:** Listed in `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/node/service/Cargo.toml` (line 72-73)
```rust
sc-transaction-pool = { workspace = true }
sc-transaction-pool-api = { workspace = true }
```

2. **Standard Implementation:** Built using the standard builder pattern in `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/node/service/src/lib.rs` (lines 558-565):
```rust
let transaction_pool = sc_transaction_pool::Builder::new(
    task_manager.spawn_handle(),
    client.clone(),
    config.role.is_authority().into(),
)
.with_options(config.transaction_pool.clone())
.with_prometheus(config.prometheus_registry())
.build();
```

3. **Block Authoring:** Uses standard `sc_basic_authorship::ProposerFactory` for block building (line 1011-1017):
```rust
let proposer_factory = sc_basic_authorship::ProposerFactory::with_proof_recording(
    task_manager.spawn_handle(),
    client.clone(),
    transaction_pool,
    prometheus_registry,
    telemetry.clone(),
);
```

4. **Collator Service:** Wrapped with `cumulus_client_consensus_proposer::Proposer` for parachain block production (line 1019)

### Direct Usage Analysis

**Finding:** Moonbeam does not directly call `ready_at_light` or `ready_at` anywhere in its codebase.

**Evidence:** A comprehensive search showed:
- No direct usage of `ready_at_light` in moonbeam's codebase
- No custom transaction pool implementations
- Uses standard Substrate block authoring components that internally handle transaction pool interactions
- Manual sealing implementation (dev mode) only uses `pool.status()` for simple status checks

### Impact Assessment

**Risk Level:** LOW
**Action Required:** NONE
**Breaking Changes:** NO (despite major version bump)

#### Analysis

1. **Internal Improvement:** This is an internal transaction pool enhancement that doesn't change the public API. The `ready_at_light` function signature remains unchanged.

2. **Automatic Benefit:** Since Moonbeam uses the standard `sc-transaction-pool`, the improvement will automatically apply when upgrading to stable2506.

3. **Improved Block Production:** The fallback mechanism will improve Moonbeam's block production reliability in edge cases, particularly:
   - When building on non-canonical blocks during temporary forks
   - During network partitions or high uncle block rates
   - When collators need to build backup blocks

4. **No Custom Logic Impact:** Moonbeam doesn't override or customize transaction pool's ready transaction logic, so no code updates are needed.

5. **Collator Benefits:** As a parachain collator, Moonbeam will benefit from more robust transaction availability when building candidate blocks, even on fork scenarios.

### Major Version Bump Explanation

The crate receives a `major` version bump to signal internal significance for downstream consumers tracking this dependency. However, there are no breaking API changes - the bump reflects the importance of the behavioral change for production systems.

## Benefits for Moonbeam

1. **Better Transaction Availability:** Collators will have access to ready transactions even in edge cases where views don't exist for specific parent blocks.

2. **Improved Block Fullness:** Reduced likelihood of producing empty or near-empty blocks due to transaction pool view misses.

3. **Enhanced Fork Handling:** More robust behavior during network conditions that produce temporary forks.

4. **No Degradation:** The fallback only activates when the previous behavior would have returned nothing, so there's no risk of regression.

## Testing Considerations

**No specific testing required** because:
- The change is transparent to Moonbeam's code
- Existing transaction pool integration tests continue to pass
- The improvement has been validated upstream with comprehensive test coverage
- The fallback only activates in edge cases that would previously fail

However, it would be beneficial to:
- Monitor collator logs after upgrading for any transaction pool related warnings
- Verify block production metrics remain consistent or improve
- Observe behavior during periods of network congestion or temporary forks

## Related PRs in stable2506

This PR is part of a series of transaction pool improvements in stable2506:
- PR #8500: Fixed transaction removal from unlocks set (internal bookkeeping)
- PR #8001: Structured logging with tracing (observability improvement)
- PR #7980: Various fork-aware transaction pool enhancements
- PR #8533: This PR - `ready_at_light` fallback

All of these PRs improve transaction pool reliability and maintainability without requiring changes to Moonbeam's code.

## Recommendations

1. **No Action Required:** Simply upgrade `sc-transaction-pool` as part of the normal stable2506 upgrade process.

2. **Monitor Metrics:** After upgrading, monitor:
   - Block fullness metrics
   - Transaction inclusion rates
   - Collator performance during fork scenarios

3. **No Migration Needed:** This enhancement doesn't require any runtime or client migrations.

4. **Documentation:** Consider noting in release notes that transaction pool reliability improvements are included in the upgrade.

## Conclusion

PR #8533 provides a valuable improvement to the transaction pool's robustness when handling edge cases in block production on forks. Moonbeam will automatically benefit from this enhancement when upgrading to stable2506, with no code changes or special considerations required. The improvement enhances collator reliability, particularly during network conditions that produce temporary forks or when building on non-canonical blocks.
