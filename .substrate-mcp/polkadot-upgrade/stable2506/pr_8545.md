# PR #8545: [pallet-revive] eth-rpc improved healthcheck

## Overview
- **PR**: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8545
- **Audience**: Runtime Dev
- **Status**: Merged (May 16, 2025)

## Summary
This PR improves the healthcheck mechanism for the Ethereum RPC service in pallet-revive by:
- Verifying that the cached latest block is properly synchronized
- Adding additional trace logging to debug broken block subscription issues

## Changes

### Affected Crates
- `sc-rpc-server` - patch bump
- `pallet-revive-eth-rpc` - patch bump

### Technical Details
The changes enhance the reliability of block synchronization monitoring in the eth-rpc service for pallet-revive, addressing issues raised in paritytech/contract-issues#72.

## Impact on Moonbeam

**NO IMPACT**

### Reasoning
1. **Moonbeam does not use pallet-revive**: Pallet-revive is a Substrate-native smart contracts pallet. Moonbeam uses `pallet-evm` (from the Frontier project) for Ethereum smart contract compatibility instead.

2. **No dependency on affected crates**:
   - Moonbeam does not depend on `pallet-revive-eth-rpc` in any Cargo.toml files
   - While `sc-rpc-server` appears in Cargo.lock as a transitive dependency, the patch-level changes to this crate are internal to pallet-revive's healthcheck mechanism and do not affect moonbeam's usage

3. **Different architecture**: Moonbeam's Ethereum compatibility layer is built on:
   - `pallet-evm` for EVM execution
   - Frontier RPC services (not pallet-revive-eth-rpc)
   - Custom precompiles for Substrate-to-EVM integration

## Action Required

**None** - This PR can be safely ignored for the moonbeam upgrade to stable2506.

## Verification

Searched moonbeam codebase for:
- `pallet-revive` - Not found in any Cargo.toml
- `pallet-revive-eth-rpc` - Not found in any Cargo.toml
- `pallet-contracts` - Not found (confirming moonbeam doesn't use Substrate-native contracts)
- `pallet-evm` - Found in all runtime Cargo.toml files (confirming Frontier-based architecture)
