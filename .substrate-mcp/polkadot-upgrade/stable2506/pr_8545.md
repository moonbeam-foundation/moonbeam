# PR #8545: [pallet-revive] eth-rpc improved healthcheck

## Overview

**Status:** Merged (May 16, 2025)
**Author:** pgherveou
**Labels:** T7-smart_contracts
**Issue Reference:** paritytech/contract-issues#72

## Summary

This PR improves the healthcheck mechanism for pallet-revive's Ethereum RPC implementation. It ensures that the cached latest block is properly synced during healthcheck and adds additional tracing to debug broken block subscriptions.

## Changes

### Affected Crates
- `sc-rpc-server` (patch bump)
- `pallet-revive-eth-rpc` (patch bump)

### Key Improvements
1. **Enhanced Healthcheck**: The healthcheck now verifies that the cached latest block is properly synchronized
2. **Improved Debugging**: Additional traces added to help debug issues with block subscription

## Impact Analysis for Moonbeam

### Direct Impact: NONE

**Reasoning:**
- Moonbeam does not use `pallet-revive` or `pallet-revive-eth-rpc`
- The changes are specific to pallet-revive's implementation of Ethereum RPC
- Moonbeam uses its own Ethereum compatibility layer through Frontier pallets (`pallet-evm`, `pallet-ethereum`, etc.)

### Indirect Impact: MINIMAL

**sc-rpc-server changes:**
- This is a core Substrate component that receives a patch bump
- Changes appear to be focused on healthcheck functionality specific to pallet-revive's use case
- No breaking changes or API modifications that would affect Moonbeam's RPC infrastructure

## Context

### What is pallet-revive?
Pallet-revive is a newer smart contract pallet in the Polkadot SDK ecosystem that provides an alternative to pallet-contracts. It includes an Ethereum RPC compatibility layer (`pallet-revive-eth-rpc`) that allows Ethereum tools and wallets to interact with revive contracts.

### How is this different from Moonbeam?
- **Moonbeam**: Full EVM compatibility through Frontier pallets, providing a complete Ethereum-compatible environment
- **pallet-revive**: RISC-V based smart contract execution with Ethereum RPC compatibility layer on top

## Recommendations

### Action Required: NONE

This PR does not require any changes to Moonbeam's codebase.

### Monitoring Suggestions

While no action is required, it may be worth noting:
1. The approach to healthcheck improvements in pallet-revive-eth-rpc could provide insights for Moonbeam's own RPC healthcheck mechanisms if such features are being considered
2. The debugging traces for block subscription issues might offer patterns applicable to Moonbeam's block subscription handling

## Technical Details

### Audience
- Runtime Dev

### Description from PRDoc
- Check that the cached latest block is properly synced in the healthcheck
- Add additional traces to debug broken block subscription

### Review Status
