# PR #8547: Disable check-runtime-migration

**Impact**: INHERITED
**Confidence**: High
**Affected Components**: None

## Changes Detected

This PR temporarily disables a CI job called `check-runtime-migration` in Polkadot SDK. The change was made because Westend's state became broken after dropping some messages in a previous upgrade. This is a CI-only change that does not modify any production code or runtime logic.

The PR:
- Disabled the `check-runtime-migration` CI job
- Marked as an R0-silent change (no impact on production code)
- Intended as a temporary measure until the Westend state issue is resolved

## Project Impact

**No impact on Moonbeam.**

This PR only affects Polkadot SDK's internal CI infrastructure for testing Westend runtime migrations. It does not:
- Change any runtime APIs
- Modify migration logic
- Alter runtime behavior
- Affect downstream projects' CI pipelines

Moonbeam does not use or depend on Polkadot SDK's `check-runtime-migration` CI job. Moonbeam has its own CI pipeline defined in `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/.github/workflows/build.yml` which includes:
- Runtime upgrade tests via Chopsticks (`chopsticks-upgrade-test` job)
- Zombie network upgrade tests (`zombie_upgrade_test` job)
- Lazy loading migration tests (`lazy-loading-tests` job)

These are independent of Polkadot SDK's CI infrastructure.

   - Found 26 files with try-runtime references (Cargo.toml files, migrations.rs, etc.)
   - Located at: `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/common/src/migrations.rs`
   - Includes custom migration utilities like `RemovePallet<T, P>` with try-runtime support
   - Features: `pre_upgrade()` and `post_upgrade()` hooks for migration testing

3. **Moonbeam's CI workflow:**
   - Location: `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/.github/workflows/build.yml`
   - Contains independent runtime upgrade test jobs:
     - Line 769-814: `chopsticks-upgrade-test` - Tests upgrades using Chopsticks framework
     - Line 816-887: `zombie_upgrade_test` - Tests upgrades in zombie network environment
     - Line 710-767: `lazy-loading-tests` - Tests lazy migrations

4. **Runtime migration code:**
   - `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/common/src/migrations.rs` defines:
     - `SingleBlockMigrations<Runtime>` - Single block migrations
     - `MultiBlockMigrations<Runtime>` - Multi-block stepped migrations
     - `RemovePallet<T, P>` - Stepped migration with try-runtime support

## Conclusion

This is a Polkadot SDK internal CI change with no impact on Moonbeam. The disabled CI job is specific to Polkadot SDK's testing infrastructure and does not affect downstream parachains. Moonbeam's own runtime migration testing infrastructure remains unaffected and continues to function independently.
