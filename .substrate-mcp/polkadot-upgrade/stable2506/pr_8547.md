- **Audience**: Runtime Dev
- **Classification**: R0-silent (no crate changes, no production code impact)

## Summary
This PR temporarily disables the `check-runtime-migration` CI job in the Polkadot SDK repository due to broken Westend state following a recent upgrade that dropped some messages.

- **Commits**: 2
- **Crates Affected**: None (CI/infrastructure only)

## Description
According to the PRDoc and PR description:
> westend state is fully broken since we dropped some messages on latest upgrade
> I am disabling this job for now until we can resolve the issue

This is a temporary measure to keep CI passing while the underlying Westend state issue is resolved.

## Technical Context

### What is check-runtime-migration?
The `check-runtime-migration` CI job validates that runtime upgrades properly migrate on-chain state. It ensures that storage migrations work correctly and don't leave the chain in a broken state.

### Why was it disabled?
During a recent Westend upgrade, some messages were dropped, which broke the state in a way that prevented migration checks from passing. Rather than blocking all CI, the team temporarily disabled this specific check.

### Temporary Nature
A related PR (#8550) was opened to revert this change, indicating that:
1. This is intended as a temporary fix
2. The team plans to re-enable checks once the Westend state issue is resolved
3. There may be ongoing work to fix the underlying state problem

## Impact on Moonbeam

### Direct Impact: NONE
This PR only affects Polkadot SDK CI infrastructure and does not modify any production code, runtime logic, or dependencies that Moonbeam uses.

### Classification: **No Action Required**

### Reasoning:
1. **CI-Only Change**: This only affects the Polkadot SDK's own CI pipeline
2. **Westend-Specific**: The state issue is specific to the Westend relay chain, not parachain runtimes
3. **No Code Changes**: No runtime pallets, client code, or libraries were modified
4. **R0-Silent**: Confirmed by reviewers as not affecting production code

### Monitoring Considerations:
While this PR requires no action, it's worth noting:
- The Polkadot SDK team encountered state migration issues during upgrades
- This highlights the importance of thorough migration testing
- Moonbeam should continue to validate its own migration tests when upgrading

## Review Notes
- **Approved by**: athei, kianenigma, xermicus
- **Review Comment**: ggwpez confirmed "a proper R0-silent since it does not change production code"
- **CI Status**: 261 of 270 checks passed

## Recommendations for Moonbeam

1. **No immediate action required** - this is purely a Polkadot SDK CI change
2. **Monitor follow-up PRs** that re-enable this check to understand the resolution
3. **Continue testing migrations** in Moonbeam's own CI independently
4. **Review migration testing practices** to ensure comprehensive coverage

## Related PRs
- **#8550**: Appears to be a revert or follow-up to re-enable the check

## Conclusion
This is an **informational-only** PR for Moonbeam. It represents a temporary CI workaround in the Polkadot SDK and has no impact on Moonbeam's runtime, client, or testing infrastructure. No changes or actions are required in the Moonbeam codebase.
