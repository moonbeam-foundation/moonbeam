# PR #8559: [pallet-revive] rename DepositLimit::Unchecked & minor code cleanup

## Summary

This PR renames `DepositLimit::Unchecked` to `DepositLimit::UnsafeOnlyForDryRun` in pallet-revive and performs minor code cleanup for the pallet-revive Ethereum RPC implementation.

## Changes

- **Primary Change**: Renamed `DepositLimit::Unchecked` to `DepositLimit::UnsafeOnlyForDryRun` to better communicate that this variant is intended exclusively for dry-run operations and carries safety implications
- **Secondary Changes**: General code cleanup and improvements to the pallet-revive RPC module

## Affected Crates

- `pallet-revive-eth-rpc` (patch bump)
- `pallet-revive` (major bump)

## Impact on Moonbeam

**NO IMPACT**

### Analysis

Moonbeam does not use pallet-revive or pallet-contracts. The codebase search confirms:

1. No references to `pallet-revive` or `pallet-contracts` in any Cargo.toml files
2. The only `DepositLimit` references found are `storageDepositLimit` in TypeScript API files, which are related to pallet-contracts RPC types (not pallet-revive)
3. Moonbeam uses pallet-evm (from Frontier) for smart contract execution, not WASM-based contracts

### Rationale

- **pallet-revive** is a new pallet for WASM-based smart contracts with Ethereum RPC compatibility
- **pallet-contracts** is the predecessor WASM contract pallet
- **Moonbeam** achieves Ethereum compatibility through pallet-evm, which directly executes EVM bytecode

Since moonbeam doesn't depend on or interact with pallet-revive, this renaming change has no impact on the codebase.

## Action Required

None. No changes needed in moonbeam codebase.
