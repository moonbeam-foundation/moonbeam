# PR 8584: Remove XCM Dependencies from pallet-revive

## Overview
- **PR**: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8584
- **Audience**: Runtime Dev
- **Impact**: NO IMPACT on Moonbeam

## Summary
This PR removes all XCM dependencies from `pallet-revive` to prevent circular dependency issues. The `mock-network` crate used for testing XCM APIs (`xcm_execute` and `xcm_send`) was removed, and these APIs were relocated to an XCM precompile within `pallet-xcm`.

## Changes Made
1. Removed `mock-network` crate from pallet-revive
2. Removed `CallFilter` from pallet configuration
3. Moved `xcm_execute` and `xcm_send` precompile APIs to `pallet-xcm`
4. Cleaned up related test infrastructure and fixtures

## Affected Crates
- `pallet-revive` (major)
- `pallet-revive-uapi` (major)
- `asset-hub-westend-runtime` (major)
- `penpal-runtime` (major)

## Impact on Moonbeam

### Analysis
Moonbeam does not use `pallet-revive`. The project uses:
- `pallet-evm` (from Frontier) for Ethereum compatibility
- Custom precompiles for extended functionality
- XCM integration through `pallet-xcm` and custom XCM configuration

**Search Results:**
- No instances of `pallet-revive` or `pallet_revive` found in moonbeam codebase
- Only references found were in previous upgrade analysis documents

### Conclusion
**NO ACTION REQUIRED**

This is purely a pallet-revive internal refactoring that doesn't affect Moonbeam's architecture or dependencies.

## Migration Required
None - Moonbeam doesn't use the affected pallet.

## Testing Recommendations
None required.
