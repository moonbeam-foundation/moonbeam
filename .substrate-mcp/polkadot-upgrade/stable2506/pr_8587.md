# PR 8587: Make Subscription Task Panic on Error in pallet-revive

## Overview
- **PR**: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8587
- **Audience**: Runtime Dev
- **Impact**: NO IMPACT on Moonbeam

## Summary
This PR makes subscription tasks in pallet-revive-eth-rpc "essential tasks" that will cause the service to shut down on failure rather than continuing silently. It also upgrades subxt to 0.41 and updates zombienet-sdk to use subxt re-exports.

## Changes Made
1. **Subscription Task Handling**: Changed error handling so subscription task failures cause service shutdown
2. **Subxt Upgrade**: Upgraded from an older version to subxt 0.41
3. **Zombienet-SDK Integration**: Modified to use subxt re-exports to prevent version conflicts

## Affected Crates
- `pallet-revive-eth-rpc` (patch)
- `frame-benchmarking-cli` (patch)

## Modified Files
- `substrate/frame/revive/rpc/src/client.rs` - Core RPC client implementation
- Dependency configurations across test and integration modules
- Various subxt API call sites

## Impact on Moonbeam

### Analysis
Moonbeam does not use `pallet-revive` or its RPC implementation. The project uses:
- Frontier's `fc-rpc` for Ethereum RPC compatibility
- Custom RPC methods in `moonbeam-rpc-*` crates
- Different subscription management architecture

**Search Results:**
- No instances of `pallet-revive` found in moonbeam codebase
- Moonbeam has its own RPC implementation based on Frontier

### Behavioral Changes
The PR changes error handling behavior for subscription tasks, but this only affects pallet-revive-eth-rpc users.

### Conclusion
**NO ACTION REQUIRED**

This is specific to pallet-revive's RPC implementation and doesn't affect Moonbeam's Frontier-based RPC stack.

## Migration Required
None - Moonbeam doesn't use the affected RPC implementation.

## Testing Recommendations
None required.
