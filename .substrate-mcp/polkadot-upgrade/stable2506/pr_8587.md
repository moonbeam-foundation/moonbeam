# PR #8587: [pallet-revive] make subscription task panic on error

**Impact**: INHERITED
**Confidence**: High
**Affected Components**: None (Moonbeam does not use pallet-revive)

## Changes Detected

This PR makes three key changes:
1. Makes subscription tasks "essential tasks" that cause the service to panic/go down when they fail (for pallet-revive-eth-rpc)
2. Upgrades subxt dependency from 0.40 to 0.41
3. Updates zombienet-sdk to use subxt re-export to avoid version conflicts

The PR modifies two crates:
- `pallet-revive-eth-rpc` (patch bump)
- `frame-benchmarking-cli` (patch bump)

## Project Impact

**No direct code changes required for Moonbeam.**

### Analysis:

1. **pallet-revive**: Moonbeam does NOT use pallet-revive or pallet-revive-eth-rpc. Moonbeam is based on Frontier's pallet-evm, not the newer pallet-revive (which is Polkadot's newer smart contract platform). A search of the codebase confirms:
   - No references to `pallet-revive` or `pallet_revive` in any Cargo.toml files
   - Only mentions of "revive" are in historical analysis documents in `.substrate-mcp/polkadot-upgrade/stable2506/`

2. **subxt upgrade (0.40 â†’ 0.41)**: Moonbeam already has subxt 0.41.0 in Cargo.lock, indicating the dependency has already been updated through the polkadot-sdk upgrade. This is an INHERITED change.
   - Current version in Moonbeam's Cargo.lock: `subxt = "0.41.0"`
   - subxt is used in CI workflows (`.github/workflows/subxt-diff.yml`) but installed separately via `cargo install subxt-cli@0.37.0`

3. **frame-benchmarking-cli**: Moonbeam uses this crate for benchmarking operations:
   - Referenced in `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/Cargo.toml` (workspace dependencies)
   - Used in `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/node/cli/Cargo.toml`
   - Imported in `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/node/cli/src/command.rs` for `SUBSTRATE_REFERENCE_HARDWARE`

   However, the changes to frame-benchmarking-cli appear to be related to zombienet-sdk integration and do not affect Moonbeam's usage of the benchmarking CLI constants/utilities. The subscription task changes are specific to pallet-revive-eth-rpc and don't affect frame-benchmarking-cli's public API that Moonbeam uses.

### Search Results:

**pallet-revive usage:**
```
No matches found in:

**subxt version:**

# From Cargo.lock

**frame-benchmarking-cli usage:**
```rust
// /Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/node/cli/src/command.rs:22
use frame_benchmarking_cli::{BenchmarkCmd, SUBSTRATE_REFERENCE_HARDWARE};

// /Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/node/cli/src/command.rs:681
frame_benchmarking_cli::SUBSTRATE_REFERENCE_HARDWARE.clone(),
```

**Moonbeam uses pallet-evm, not pallet-revive:**
```
Found 31 files referencing pallet-evm across:
- All three runtimes (moonbase, moonriver, moonbeam)
- All precompiles
- Custom pallets
```

## Recommendation

**No action required.** This PR's changes are either:
- Not applicable (pallet-revive - Moonbeam uses pallet-evm instead)
- Already inherited through the polkadot-sdk dependency update (subxt 0.41)
- Internal implementation details that don't affect Moonbeam's usage (frame-benchmarking-cli zombienet integration)

The stable2506 branch upgrade automatically brings in these changes without requiring any code modifications in Moonbeam.
