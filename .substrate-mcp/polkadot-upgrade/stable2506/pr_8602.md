# PR #8602: [stable2503] Backport #8585 - fix epmb solution duplicate issue + add remote mining apparatus to epm

**Impact**: INHERITED
**Confidence**: High
**Affected Components**: None

## Changes Detected

This PR is a backport of PR #8585 to the stable2503 branch, which subsequently made it into stable2506. The original PR #8585 addresses two key issues in the Election Provider Multi-Block (EPMB) pallet:

1. **Duplicate Voter Fix**: Fixes an issue where duplicate voters could appear in the solution type
2. **Remote Mining Apparatus**: Adds remote mining functionality to the Election Provider Multi-Block system

### Affected Polkadot SDK Components

- `pallet-election-provider-multi-block` (fixes and enhancements)
- `pallet-election-provider-multi-phase` (related changes)

The changes are feature-gated and include test modifications for remote mining scenarios.

## Project Impact

**No impact on Moonbeam**. This PR targets the Election Provider Multi-Block pallet which is not used by Moonbeam.

### Analysis

Moonbeam does not use any of the affected components:

1. **No Election Provider Dependencies**: Moonbeam does not import or use `pallet-election-provider-multi-block` or `pallet-election-provider-multi-phase`
2. **Custom Staking Implementation**: Moonbeam uses its own custom `pallet-parachain-staking` for collator selection and delegation
3. **Different Architecture**: The election provider pallets are designed for Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS) systems used by relay chains, while Moonbeam uses direct delegation in a parachain context

From the `pallet-parachain-staking` documentation:
> The main difference between this pallet and `frame/pallet-staking` is that this pallet uses direct delegation. Delegators choose exactly who they delegate and with what stake. This is different from `frame/pallet-staking` where delegators approval vote and run Phragmen.

The EPMB (Election Provider Multi-Block) system is used for running validator elections over multiple blocks, which is relevant to relay chains but not to Moonbeam's parachain architecture.

### Runtime Configuration

Moonbeam's runtime configuration at `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonbeam/src/lib.rs` shows:
- `ParachainStaking: pallet_parachain_staking` - Custom staking implementation with direct delegation
- No election-provider pallets configured
- No dependencies on NPoS (Nominated Proof-of-Stake) election mechanisms

### Parachain Staking Architecture

The custom `pallet-parachain-staking` implementation at `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/pallets/parachain-staking/src/lib.rs` shows:
- Direct delegation model (delegators choose specific collators)
- No use of election algorithms like Phragmen
- Round-based collator selection by total backed stake
- No imports or dependencies on election-provider pallets

### Conclusion

The changes in PR #8602 (backport of #8585) are entirely self-contained within the election-provider-multi-block ecosystem. These changes will be inherited automatically through the Polkadot SDK version bump without requiring any code changes in Moonbeam. The functionality being improved is not used by Moonbeam's runtime architecture, as Moonbeam implements its own direct delegation staking system for collator selection rather than using the relay chain's NPoS election mechanisms.
