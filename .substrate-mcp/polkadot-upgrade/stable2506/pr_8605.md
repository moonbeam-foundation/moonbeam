# PR #8605: Not Found in stable2506 Release

**Impact**: DON'T KNOW
**Confidence**: High
**Affected Components**: Unknown

## Investigation Summary

PR #8605 was not found in the Polkadot SDK stable2506 release. After extensive investigation, the following facts were established:

1. **PR Documentation Missing**: No prdoc file exists for PR #8605 in the stable2506 release
2. **Not in Analyzed Set**: The stable2506 directory contains 55 analyzed PRs (ranging from PR #5884 to PR #8274), but PR #8605 is conspicuously absent from this list
3. **Gap in Sequence**: PR #8605 falls within a large gap of unanalyzed PRs between #5884 and #8274
4. **GitHub Access Limited**: GitHub API rate limits prevented direct verification of whether PR #8605 exists at all

## Possible Explanations

1. **PR Does Not Exist**: PR #8605 may not exist in the polkadot-sdk repository (possibly an issue number instead)
2. **Not Part of Release**: PR #8605 was not included in the stable2506 release branch
3. **No PRDoc File**: PR #8605 exists but does not have an accompanying prdoc documentation file
4. **Merged to Different Branch**: PR was merged to a different release branch or the main development branch
