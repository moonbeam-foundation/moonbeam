# PR #8652: [pallet-revive] impl_revive_api macro

**Impact**: INHERITED
**Confidence**: High
**Affected Components**: None

## Changes Detected

This PR introduces a macro (`impl_revive_api`) to implement the ReviveApi runtime API for pallet-revive. The purpose is to reduce code duplication across different runtimes by providing a reusable macro implementation.

Key changes:
- Created `impl_revive_api!` macro to standardize ReviveApi implementation
- Applied to asset-hub-westend-runtime as an example
- Reduces boilerplate code for runtimes that use pallet-revive

## Project Impact

**No impact on Moonbeam.**

Moonbeam does not use pallet-revive. The project uses Frontier's pallet-evm for Ethereum compatibility, not pallet-revive (which is Polkadot SDK's WASM-based smart contract pallet).

Evidence:
- No references to `pallet-revive`, `impl_revive_api`, or `ReviveApi` found in the Moonbeam codebase
- Moonbeam's runtime dependencies (checked `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonbase/Cargo.toml`) show:
  - Uses `pallet-evm` and `pallet-ethereum` from Frontier
  - No pallet-revive or pallet-contracts dependencies
  - Smart contract functionality is provided through EVM, not WASM contracts

### Moonbeam's Smart Contract Architecture

Moonbeam uses **pallet-evm** (Frontier) for Ethereum compatibility:
- Solidity contracts compiled to EVM bytecode
- Ethereum-compatible execution environment
- Does NOT use Substrate's WASM-based smart contracts (pallet-contracts/pallet-revive)

This is a fundamental architectural choice that means pallet-revive changes are not applicable.

## Conclusion

This PR has **no impact** on Moonbeam. The changes are specific to pallet-revive, which is not used in the Moonbeam runtime. Moonbeam's Ethereum compatibility is achieved through Frontier's pallet-evm, not through Substrate's WASM smart contract pallets.
