# PR #8652 Analysis: [pallet-revive] impl_revive_api macro

## Overview

**PR**: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8652
**Status**: Merged
**Audience**: Runtime Dev
**Impact on Moonbeam**: ❌ **None** - Not relevant

## Summary

This PR introduces the `impl_revive_api` macro to consolidate pallet-revive runtime API implementations, reducing code duplication across runtimes. The macro encapsulates common runtime API implementation patterns that were previously repeated for each runtime integration.

## Changes

- **Type**: Developer experience / code refactoring
- **Crates affected**:
  - `pallet-revive` (minor bump)
  - `asset-hub-westend-runtime` (patch bump)
- **Code impact**: Net reduction of ~123 lines (removed 372, added 249)

### Technical Details

The macro addresses the limitation that `sp_api::decl_runtime_apis!` doesn't support default trait implementations, requiring runtime-specific implementations for each integration. The `impl_revive_api` macro provides a reusable pattern that:
- Accesses concrete runtime types
- Implements the ReviveApi trait consistently
- Reduces boilerplate in runtime configurations

## Impact on Moonbeam

**Impact Level**: None

**Rationale**:
- Moonbeam uses **pallet-evm** and Frontier for Ethereum compatibility, not pallet-revive
- pallet-revive is a WASM smart contracts pallet (successor to pallet-contracts)
- This is purely an internal refactoring for pallet-revive integration
- No changes to existing APIs, pallets, or functionality that Moonbeam depends on

## Action Required

✅ **No action needed** - This change can be safely ignored during the stable2506 upgrade.

## Additional Context

**Development Notes**:
- Initial implementation surfaced an RPC error ("Exported method ReviveApi_balance is not found") that was fixed in subsequent commits
- Reviewers initially questioned whether default trait implementations could work, but sp_api limitations necessitate the macro approach
- PR was approved by @athei and @xermicus on May 27, 2025

**Related Work**:
- Part of the ongoing pallet-revive smart contracts development (T7-smart_contracts)
- Improves developer experience for teams integrating pallet-revive into their runtimes
