# PR #8664: [pallet-revive] Fix rpc-types

**Impact**: INHERITED
**Confidence**: High
**Affected Components**: None (Moonbeam does not use pallet-revive)

## Changes Detected

This PR updates RPC types for pallet-revive with the following changes:
- Removes unnecessary derive traits from RPC types
- Fixes JSON decoding for `BlockNumberOrTagOrHash`
- Patch-level bump for pallet-revive crate

## Project Impact

**No direct impact on Moonbeam.**

Moonbeam uses `pallet-evm` from Frontier for Ethereum compatibility, not `pallet-revive`. While `pallet-revive` appears in the Cargo.lock as a transitive dependency (pulled in from the Polkadot SDK workspace), it is not directly used or configured in any Moonbeam runtime or component.

### Verification:

1. **pallet-evm is used, not pallet-revive**: All three Moonbeam runtimes (moonbase, moonriver, moonbeam) use `pallet-evm` and various `pallet-evm-precompile-*` crates from Frontier
   - Reference: `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonbase/Cargo.toml:133` (and equivalent in moonriver/moonbeam)

2. **No direct pallet-revive dependency**: Searched all Cargo.toml files - pallet-revive is not declared as a dependency in any Moonbeam component

3. **Transitive dependency only**: pallet-revive appears in Cargo.lock at line 10986 as a transitive dependency from the Polkadot SDK fork, but is not referenced by any Moonbeam crate

## Evidence & References

### Cargo.lock verification:
```
Line 10986: name = "pallet-revive"
Line 10987: version = "0.7.0"
Line 10988: source = "git+https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/polkadot-sdk?branch=moonbeam-polkadot-stable2506#4f1bceaa883a82b84df411b9081dcc7b09ab7a7e"
```

### Runtime verification (pallet-evm usage):
```
/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonbase/Cargo.toml:133:pallet-evm = { workspace = true, features = ["forbid-evm-reentrancy"] }
/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonriver/Cargo.toml (similar)
/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonbeam/Cargo.toml (similar)
```

### Search results:
- `rg "pallet-revive|pallet_revive" Cargo.toml runtime/*/Cargo.toml` â†’ No matches in direct dependencies
- pallet-revive only appears in analysis markdown files from previous stable2506 PRs

## Conclusion

This PR's changes to pallet-revive RPC types are inherited through the Polkadot SDK upgrade but have no functional impact on Moonbeam since the project uses Frontier's pallet-evm for Ethereum compatibility. No action required.
