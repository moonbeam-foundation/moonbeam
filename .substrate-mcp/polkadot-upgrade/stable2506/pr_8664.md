# PR #8664 Analysis: [pallet-revive] Fix rpc-types

## Overview

- **PR Number**: #8664
- **Title**: [pallet-revive] Fix rpc-types
- **Status**: Merged (May 27, 2025)
- **Author**: pgherveou
- **Reviewers**: xermicus, athei
- **Labels**: T7-smart_contracts
- **Audience**: Runtime Dev
- **Crate Bump**: pallet-revive (patch)

## Summary

This PR updates RPC type definitions for the pallet-revive module, addressing technical debt and fixing a JSON decoding issue.

## Changes

### Main Changes
1. **Removed unnecessary derive traits** from RPC type definitions
   - Cleaned up trait implementations that were not being used
   - Reviewer noted: "I wouldn't entirely rule out anyone needing encoding of those however I can't think of anything currently"

2. **Fixed JSON decoding for `BlockNumberOrTagOrHash`**
   - Corrected deserialization logic for this RPC type
   - Ensures proper handling of block number, tag, or hash parameters in RPC calls

### Affected Crates
- `pallet-revive`: patch bump

## Impact Assessment for Moonbeam

### Relevance: LOW

**Rationale:**
- **pallet-revive is NOT used by Moonbeam**: Moonbeam uses `pallet-evm` for Ethereum compatibility, not `pallet-revive` (which is for PolkaVM/RISC-V smart contracts)
- **Isolated changes**: The modifications are contained within pallet-revive's RPC types
- **No runtime logic changes**: This is purely an RPC interface improvement

### Dependencies
Moonbeam does not depend on pallet-revive in any of its runtimes:
- moonbeam-runtime
- moonriver-runtime
- moonbase-runtime

### Breaking Changes
None identified.

### Migration Required
No migration required for Moonbeam.

## Technical Details

### What is pallet-revive?
pallet-revive is a smart contracts pallet for executing PolkaVM (RISC-V) based contracts. It's distinct from:
- `pallet-contracts`: The predecessor smart contracts pallet
- `pallet-evm`: Used by Moonbeam for EVM compatibility

### RPC Type Fixes
The PR focuses on improving the developer experience when interacting with pallet-revive through RPC by:
1. Simplifying type definitions (removing unused traits)
2. Ensuring correct JSON serialization/deserialization

## Action Items for Moonbeam

- [ ] **No action required**: This PR does not affect Moonbeam's functionality
- [ ] **Monitor**: Keep aware of pallet-revive developments if future integration is considered

## Recommendations

1. **No changes needed**: This PR can be safely ignored for Moonbeam's stable2506 upgrade
2. **Continue using pallet-evm**: Moonbeam's EVM compatibility strategy remains unchanged

- **GitHub PR**: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8664
- **Related Pallets**: pallet-revive, pallet-contracts, pallet-evm

## Conclusion

PR #8664 is a maintenance update for pallet-revive that improves RPC type definitions. Since Moonbeam does not use pallet-revive and relies exclusively on pallet-evm for smart contract execution, this PR has **no impact** on the Moonbeam project. No code changes, testing, or migration steps are required.
