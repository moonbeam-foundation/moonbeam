# PR #8687: Staking (EPMB): Add defensive error handling to voter snapshot creation and solution verification

**Impact**: INHERITED
**Confidence**: High
**Affected Components**: None (pallet not used)

## Changes Detected

This PR adds defensive error handling to `pallet-election-provider-multi-block` (EPMB):

1. **Refactored snapshot creation** to emit events and trigger defensive panic on failure instead of returning errors
2. **Replaced `unwrap()`** with `defensive_unwrap_or(u32::MAX)` to ensure solution verification fails gracefully when `desired_targets` is unavailable
3. **Added error events** for failed target and voter snapshots (`TargetSnapshotFailed`, `VoterSnapshotFailed`)

The changes improve error handling in block initialization and solution verification paths, preventing potential runtime panics.

**Crate bump**: `pallet-election-provider-multi-block` - major

## Project Impact

**No impact on Moonbeam.**

Moonbeam does not use `pallet-election-provider-multi-block` or any other election provider pallets. The project uses a custom staking implementation via `pallet-parachain-staking` which handles collator selection and delegation without election provider infrastructure.

The only reference to `pallet-staking` in the codebase is in `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/relay-encoder` which uses `pallet_staking::RewardDestination` and `pallet_staking::ValidatorPrefs` types solely for encoding relay chain staking calls to be sent via XCM transactor. This is unrelated to election provider multi-block functionality.

## Evidence & References

### Cargo.toml Search Results
```bash
# No election-provider-multi-block dependencies found
grep -r "election-provider-multi-block" /Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/*/Cargo.toml
# No results

# pallet-staking only used in relay-encoder for type imports
grep -r "pallet-staking" /Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/*/Cargo.toml
# /Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/relay-encoder/Cargo.toml:pallet-staking = { workspace = true }
```

### Runtime Construction
Moonbeam runtimes (moonbase, moonriver, moonbeam) use `pallet-parachain-staking` at index 20:
```rust
// From /Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonriver/src/lib.rs:1425
ParachainStaking: pallet_parachain_staking::{Pallet, Call, Storage, Event<T>, Config<T>} = 20,
```

### Relay Encoder Usage
The relay-encoder module only uses `pallet_staking` types for encoding:
```rust
// From /Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/relay-encoder/src/westend.rs:44-46
Bond(
    #[codec(compact)] cumulus_primitives_core::relay_chain::Balance,
    pallet_staking::RewardDestination<AccountId32>,
),
```

This is purely for XCM message construction to interact with the relay chain's staking pallet, not for local election provider functionality.

## Conclusion

This PR has **zero impact** on Moonbeam as the affected pallet is not used in any capacity. The changes will be inherited automatically through the SDK upgrade without requiring any code modifications or testing.
