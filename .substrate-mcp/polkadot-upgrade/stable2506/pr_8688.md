# PR #8688: Bound Trusted Local Cache to Shared Limits Sizes

## Overview

**PR Link:** https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8688
**Status:** Merged (May 29, 2025)
**Author:** Alexandru Gheorghe (@alexggh)
**Audience:** Node Dev
**Type:** Patch

## Summary

This PR implements size bounds on the trusted local cache in `sp-trie`, preventing it from growing past the shared cache limits. Since items stored beyond these limits would be discarded when propagated back to shared storage, there's no benefit to allowing unbounded local cache growth.

## Changes

### Affected Crate
- **sp-trie** (patch bump)

### Technical Details

The change addresses cache management by tying the trusted local cache limits to the shared cache boundaries. Previously, the local cache could potentially grow without bounds, which could lead to:
- Unnecessary memory consumption
- Potential for cache misuse
- Storing data that would ultimately be discarded

The implementation ensures that the local cache respects the same size constraints as the shared cache, making the caching strategy more efficient and predictable.

## Impact on Moonbeam

### Severity: Low

This is a node-level optimization that affects trie storage caching. The impact on Moonbeam should be minimal and positive:

**Benefits:**
1. **Memory Efficiency:** More predictable memory usage in node operations
2. **Performance:** No performance degradation expected; potentially improved cache efficiency
3. **Stability:** Prevents unbounded cache growth scenarios

**Required Actions:**
- No code changes required in Moonbeam
- No migration needed
- Standard testing after upgrade should be sufficient

### Risk Assessment

**Risk Level:** Minimal

This is an internal optimization to the trie storage caching mechanism. The change:
- Does not affect runtime logic
- Does not alter consensus behavior
- Does not change any APIs
- Is a patch-level bump indicating backward compatibility

### Testing Recommendations

1. **Standard Node Tests:** Run existing node tests to ensure proper operation
2. **Memory Monitoring:** Monitor node memory usage patterns after upgrade
3. **Performance Validation:** Verify block production and validation times remain stable

## Context

This change was motivated by feedback from PR #7556, where concerns about potential cache misuse were raised. The solution implements a pragmatic approach to cache management by preventing the local cache from exceeding shared cache capacity thresholds.

## Conclusion

This is a low-risk, node-level optimization that improves cache management efficiency. No specific action is required from the Moonbeam team beyond standard upgrade testing procedures. The change should provide minor benefits in terms of memory efficiency and cache predictability.
