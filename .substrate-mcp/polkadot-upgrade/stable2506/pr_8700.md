# PR #8700 Analysis: transfer_assets benchmarking and weights for people chains

## Overview

**PR Title:** transfer_assets benchmarking and weights for people chains
**PR Number:** #8700
**Status:** Merged (May 29, 2025)
**Related Discussion:** #8369
**Audience:** Runtime Dev

## Summary

This PR introduces a proper implementation of `set_up_complex_asset_transfer()` to correctly benchmark weights for `transfer_assets` extrinsics on Rococo People and Westend People chains. The implementation fixes invalid placeholder weights that were preventing accurate performance measurements.

## Changes

### Affected Crates
- `people-rococo-runtime` (patch bump)
- `people-westend-runtime` (patch bump)

### Modified Files
- `cumulus/parachains/runtimes/people/people-rococo/src/weights/pallet_xcm.rs`
- `cumulus/parachains/runtimes/people/people-westend/src/weights/pallet_xcm.rs`

### Key Improvements

**Before:**
- `transfer_assets` weight: ~18,446,744,073,709,551,000 picoseconds (invalid placeholder)
- This is approximately 584,942 years - clearly an invalid placeholder value

**After:**
- `transfer_assets` weight: ~298 microseconds (realistic value)
- Represents a 100% correction to proper benchmarking values

### Technical Details

The PR implements `set_up_complex_asset_transfer()` which:
1. Sets up complex asset transfer scenarios for benchmarking
2. Configures fee assets and transfer assets
3. Provides proper verification logic
4. Returns realistic weight calculations

Benchmarking command used:
```bash
bench --pallet pallet_xcm --runtime people-rococo people-westend
```

## Impact on Moonbeam

### Assessment: NO ACTION REQUIRED

**Moonbeam is NOT affected by this PR for the following reasons:**

1. **Different Runtime**: This PR only modifies People chain runtimes (people-rococo and people-westend), which are completely separate from Moonbeam's runtimes.

2. **Already Implemented**: Moonbeam already has a proper implementation of `set_up_complex_asset_transfer()` in its codebase:
   - **Location:** `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/common/src/apis.rs` (lines 916-955)
   - **Benchmark Config:** Implemented in `pallet_xcm::benchmarking::Config` for Runtime

3. **Correct Weights**: Moonbeam's `transfer_assets` weights are already realistic and properly benchmarked:
   - **Current Weight:** ~344-352 milliseconds (344_458_000 - 352_779_000 picoseconds)
   - **File:** `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonbase/src/weights/pallet_xcm.rs` (line 158-166)
   - **Last Updated:** 2025-09-02 (per benchmark metadata)

### Moonbeam's Implementation

Moonbeam's `set_up_complex_asset_transfer()` implementation includes:
- Fee asset setup using native token (ExistentialDeposit)
- Foreign asset creation and minting via `pallet_moonbeam_foreign_assets`
- Proper balance verification before and after transfer
- Returns tuple: (assets, fee_index, destination, verify_fn)

```rust
fn set_up_complex_asset_transfer(
) -> Option<(XcmAssets, u32, Location, Box<dyn FnOnce()>)> {
    use xcm_config::SelfReserve;

    let destination: xcm::v5::Location = Parent.into();
    let fee_amount: u128 = <Runtime as pallet_balances::Config>::ExistentialDeposit::get();
    let fee_asset: Asset = (SelfReserve::get(), fee_amount).into();

    // Give some multiple of transferred amount
    let balance = fee_amount * 1000;
    let who = frame_benchmarking::whitelisted_caller();
    let _ = <Balances as frame_support::traits::Currency<_>>::make_free_balance_be(&who, balance);

    // verify initial balance
    assert_eq!(Balances::free_balance(&who), balance);

    // set up foreign asset
    let asset_amount: u128 = 10u128;
    let initial_asset_amount: u128 = asset_amount * 10;

    let asset_id = pallet_moonbeam_foreign_assets::default_asset_id::<Runtime>() + 1;
    let (_, location, _) = pallet_moonbeam_foreign_assets::create_default_minted_foreign_asset::<Runtime>(
        asset_id,
        initial_asset_amount,
    );
    let transfer_asset: Asset = (AssetId(location), asset_amount).into();

    let assets: XcmAssets = vec![fee_asset.clone(), transfer_asset].into();
    let fee_index: u32 = 0;

    let verify: Box<dyn FnOnce()> = Box::new(move || {
        // verify balance after transfer, decreased by transferred amount (and delivery fees)
        assert!(Balances::free_balance(&who) <= balance - fee_amount);
    });

    Some((assets, fee_index, destination, verify))
}
```

### Weight Comparison

| Runtime | transfer_assets Weight | Status |
|---------|----------------------|--------|
| People Chains (before PR #8700) | ~18.4 quintillion ps | Invalid placeholder |
| People Chains (after PR #8700) | ~298 Î¼s | Fixed |
| Moonbeam | ~344-352 ms | Already correct |

Note: Moonbeam's higher weight is expected due to its more complex runtime with EVM integration, foreign assets, and Ethereum-XCM functionality.

## Related PRs

This PR is part of the benchmarking improvements discussed in issue #8369, which addresses missing or incorrect benchmark implementations across various runtimes.

## Recommendations

1. **No changes needed** for Moonbeam regarding this specific PR
2. **Monitor** future Polkadot SDK releases for similar benchmarking improvements
3. **Re-run benchmarks** periodically to ensure Moonbeam's weights remain accurate as the runtime evolves
4. **Consider reviewing** if any other extrinsics in Moonbeam have placeholder weights that need proper benchmarking
