# PR 8700 Impact Analysis

## PR Details
- **Title**: transfer_assets benchmarking and weights for people chains
- **URL**: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8700
- **Audience**: Runtime Dev
- **Bump**: Patch

## Summary
This PR adds proper benchmarking support for the `transfer_assets` extrinsic in the People chains (Rococo People and Westend People). Previously, the benchmark for this extrinsic was returning an overflow weight because the `set_up_complex_asset_transfer()` helper was not implemented. This PR implements the helper using native teleport as the asset transfer mechanism and updates the weights accordingly.

## Changed Crates
- `people-rococo-runtime` (patch bump)
- `people-westend-runtime` (patch bump)

## Changes Description

### Key Changes:
1. **Added `set_up_complex_asset_transfer()` implementation**:
   - Both Rococo People and Westend People runtimes now have this helper
   - Uses `pallet_xcm::benchmarking::helpers::native_teleport_as_asset_transfer`
   - Configures native location as Parent
   - Sets destination as Parent (relay chain)

2. **Updated Weights**:
   - `pallet_xcm::transfer_assets` now has proper weights instead of overflow
   - Before: `18_446_744_073_709_551_000` (u64::MAX, indicating unbenchmarkable)
   - After: `~71-73ms` execution time (proper benchmarked weight)
   - Weight breakdown:
     - Proof Size: 144 measured, 3609 estimated
     - 5 storage reads
     - 1 storage write

3. **Weight Changes for Other Extrinsics**:
   - Minor timing adjustments for other `pallet_xcm` extrinsics
   - Removed weights for `add_authorized_alias` and `remove_authorized_alias` (likely removed from pallet)
   - Updated `send`, `teleport_assets`, and version notification methods with slight timing changes

### Technical Details:
Files changed:
- `cumulus/parachains/runtimes/people/people-rococo/src/lib.rs` - Added benchmark helper
- `cumulus/parachains/runtimes/people/people-rococo/src/weights/pallet_xcm.rs` - Updated weights
- `cumulus/parachains/runtimes/people/people-westend/src/lib.rs` - Added benchmark helper
- `cumulus/parachains/runtimes/people/people-westend/src/weights/pallet_xcm.rs` - Updated weights

## Impact on Moonbeam

**IMPACT LEVEL: NONE**

### Analysis
1. **Runtime Isolation**:
   - People chains (Rococo People, Westend People) are completely separate system parachains
   - Moonbeam has its own independent runtime (moonbeam, moonriver, moonbase)
   - No dependency relationship between Moonbeam and People chain runtimes

2. **Dependency Check**:
   ```bash
   rg "people-rococo|people-westend" --type toml  # No results
   ```
   - Moonbeam does not depend on People chain runtimes
   - Changes are isolated to those specific runtime crates

3. **XCM transfer_assets Usage**:
   - While Moonbeam may use `pallet_xcm::transfer_assets` extrinsic, it has its own benchmarks
   - This PR only updates weights for the People chains specifically
   - Moonbeam would need to run its own benchmarks if it wants to use `transfer_assets`

4. **Benchmarking Pattern**:
   - The pattern shown (implementing `set_up_complex_asset_transfer`) is specific to runtime benchmarking
   - Each runtime needs its own implementation based on its configuration
   - This change doesn't affect how other runtimes implement their benchmarks

### Verification
```bash
# Confirmed no People chain dependencies:
rg "people-rococo|people-westend" --type toml  # No results

# Moonbeam has its own XCM configuration:
# - Different asset configuration
# - Different chain topology
# - Independent benchmarking
```

## Recommendation
**NO ACTION REQUIRED**

This PR is specific to People system parachains and has no bearing on Moonbeam's runtime or functionality. The changes:
- Only affect People chain runtimes (not Moonbeam)
- Are isolated to specific system parachains
- Do not change any shared libraries or dependencies
- Do not affect XCM protocols or pallet_xcm API

## Notes
- People chains are specialized system parachains for identity management in Polkadot/Kusama ecosystems
- This fix relates to issue #8369
- The benchmark helper uses native asset teleport to parent relay chain
- If Moonbeam wanted to benchmark `transfer_assets`, it would need its own implementation of `set_up_complex_asset_transfer()` tailored to its asset and chain configuration
