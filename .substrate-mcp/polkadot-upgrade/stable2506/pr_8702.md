# PR #8702: [AHM] Relax the requirement for RC-Client to receive +1 session reports

**Status:** Merged (June 4, 2025)
**Audience:** Runtime Dev
**Crates:** `pallet-staking-async-rc-client`, `pallet-staking-async`
**Bump:** Major

## Overview

This PR relaxes the strict session increment validation in the Async Horton-Musk (AHM) staking system's RC-Client to handle cases where the `ah-client` enters `Buffered` mode and skips sessions.

## Problem Statement

During Westend testing, it was discovered that when `ah-client` enters `Buffered` mode, it may skip some sessions. The existing implementation enforced strict session increments of exactly +1, which would cause the system to drop validator reward points when sessions were skipped.

## Solution

The PR implements a three-tier validation approach for session reports:

1. **Expected behavior (x+1):** Sessions that increment by exactly one proceed as designed
2. **Acceptable with warnings (x+2 or more):** Sessions that skip ahead are accepted, but warning events are emitted to alert operators
3. **Rejected (x and below):** Sessions at or below the last processed session are dropped, as they can only occur due to:
   - Unforeseen bugs in the RC-Client
   - XCM messages failing to be delivered in order

## Technical Changes

- Modified session validation logic in `pallet-staking-async-rc-client`
- Added warning event emissions for skipped sessions
- Updated assertions to allow gaps in session numbers while maintaining safety checks

## Breaking Changes

Both affected crates receive **major** version bumps:
- `pallet-staking-async-rc-client`: major bump
- `pallet-staking-async`: major bump

## Impact on Moonbeam

**Risk Level:** Low

**Analysis:**
- Moonbeam does not currently use the Async Horton-Musk (AHM) staking system
- This PR affects specialized staking pallets (`pallet-staking-async-rc-client` and `pallet-staking-async`) that are not part of Moonbeam's runtime
- Moonbeam uses `pallet-parachain-staking` for its custom staking implementation
- No action required

## Recommendation

**No action needed.** This change is specific to the AHM staking system and does not affect Moonbeam's staking implementation or runtime functionality.
