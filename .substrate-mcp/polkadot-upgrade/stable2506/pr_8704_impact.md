# PR 8704 Impact Analysis

## PR Details
- **Title**: [AHM] Repot the weights of epmb pallet to expose kusama and polkadot weights
- **URL**: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8704
- **Audience**: Runtime Dev
- **Bump**: Major

## Summary
This PR reorganizes and updates the weight files for `pallet-election-provider-multi-block` to expose separate weight configurations for Polkadot and Kusama networks. Previously, the weights were organized under a generic "measured" directory. Now they are reorganized into "traits" with specific configuration sizes (`dot_size` and `ksm_size`) that reflect the anticipated validator set sizes for each network.

## Changed Crates
- `pallet-election-provider-multi-block` (major bump)
- `pallet-staking-async-parachain-runtime` (major bump - test runtime)

## Changes Description

### Key Changes:

1. **Weight Module Reorganization**:
   - Changed from `weights::measured::*` to `weights::traits::*`
   - Split weights into network-specific files:
     - `pallet_election_provider_multi_block_dot_size.rs` - Polkadot configuration
     - `pallet_election_provider_multi_block_ksm_size.rs` - Kusama configuration
     - Same pattern for `_signed`, `_unsigned`, and `_verifier` modules

2. **Weight File Structure**:
   - Removed old structure: `kusama/measured/` and `polkadot/measured/`
   - New structure exposes weights as traits in a single location
   - Files now explicitly named by network configuration size

3. **Updated Weight Values**:
   Based on PR body, weights for different operations on DOT-size configuration:
   - `on_initialize_nothing`: ~251us
   - `on_initialize_into_snapshot_rest`: ~127ms
   - `on_initialize_into_snapshot_msp`: ~35ms
   - `export_terminal`: ~235ms
   - `export_non_terminal`: ~185ms

   And similar for KSM-size configuration with slightly different values.

4. **Template Changes**:
   - Added custom template `src/template.hbs` for weight generation
   - Template generates trait implementations instead of direct struct implementations
   - Maintains proper separation between different weight configurations

5. **Code Updates**:
   - Updated imports across the pallet to use new weight paths
   - Changed `use crate::weights::measured::*` to `use crate::weights::traits::*`
   - Updated `VerifierWeightsOf<T>` type alias path

6. **Script Updates**:
   - Updated `comp_weights.sh` to compare DOT vs KSM configurations
   - Updated `display_weights.sh` to show both configurations separately

### Technical Details:
Files changed include:
- `substrate/frame/election-provider-multi-block/src/lib.rs` - Updated weight exports
- `substrate/frame/election-provider-multi-block/src/signed/mod.rs` - Updated weight imports
- `substrate/frame/election-provider-multi-block/src/unsigned/mod.rs` - Updated weight imports
- `substrate/frame/election-provider-multi-block/src/verifier/mod.rs` - Updated weight imports
- `substrate/frame/election-provider-multi-block/src/verifier/impls.rs` - Updated type alias
- `substrate/frame/election-provider-multi-block/src/template.hbs` - New weight template
- Weight files reorganization from `measured/` to trait-based structure
- Helper scripts for comparing and displaying weights

### Background:
- This is part of the Async Backing & Handling Module (AHM) initiative
- Polkadot and Kusama have different validator set sizes
- Weights need to accurately reflect the computational cost for each network
- Benchmarks were run on reference hardware with proper configurations

## Impact on Moonbeam

**IMPACT LEVEL: NONE**

### Analysis
1. **Pallet Usage**: Moonbeam does NOT use `pallet-election-provider-multi-block`
   - Confirmed via: `rg "election-provider-multi-block" --type toml` (no results)
   - This was also verified in PR 8687 analysis

2. **Why Not Used**:
   - `pallet-election-provider-multi-block` is for relay chain NPoS validator elections
   - Moonbeam is a parachain that uses `pallet-parachain-staking` for collator selection
   - The multi-block election process is designed for relay chains, not parachains

3. **Weight Changes**:
   - Even if Moonbeam used this pallet, weight changes are typically transparent
   - Weights are runtime configuration that gets automatically applied
   - The major version bump is due to module restructuring, not behavioral changes

4. **Test Runtime Impact**:
   - `pallet-staking-async-parachain-runtime` is a test runtime used in SDK
   - Moonbeam has its own production runtimes (moonbeam, moonriver, moonbase)
   - No dependency relationship

### Verification
```bash
# Confirmed no usage:
rg "election-provider-multi-block" --type toml  # No results

# Moonbeam's staking is separate:
# - Uses pallet-parachain-staking
# - Not involved in relay chain validator elections
# - Has its own weight configurations
```

## Recommendation
**NO ACTION REQUIRED**

This PR is specific to relay chain election infrastructure that Moonbeam does not use. The changes:
- Only affect `pallet-election-provider-multi-block` weight files
- Are isolated to relay chain staking systems
- Do not change any APIs or behaviors
- Are purely organizational and optimization changes for relay chains

## Notes
- This PR is part of the broader AHM (Async Backing & Handling Module) work
- The weight separation allows Polkadot and Kusama to use network-appropriate weights
- Polkadot configuration (~3MB snapshot for validators) vs Kusama configuration (~3.2MB)
- The major version bump is due to module restructuring (changing from `measured` to `traits`)
- Benchmarks show execution times ranging from microseconds to hundreds of milliseconds depending on operation
- The new structure makes it easier to maintain separate weight configurations for different network sizes
- If Moonbeam were to ever use multi-block elections (unlikely), this would provide proper weight templates
