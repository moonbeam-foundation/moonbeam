# PR #8715: Prepare For Westend Cleanup

## Overview
- **Title**: [AHM] Prepare For Westend Cleanup
- **PR Link**: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8715
- **Audience**: Runtime Dev
- **Status**: Merged

## Summary
This PR extracts preparatory changes from a larger Westend cleanup effort (PR #7997), focusing on code quality improvements and consistency updates across multiple FRAME pallets and frame-support.

## Changes
Key modifications include:

1. **Hypothetically Macro Fix**: Corrected to properly use `Result` type for error handling
2. **DefensiveTruncateInto**: New trait added as counterpart to `DefensiveTruncateFrom`
3. **DecodeWithMemTracking**: Added derive macro to multiple structures for memory tracking during decoding
4. **Storage Visibility**: Made various storage items public

### Affected Crates
- **Major Bumps**:
  - `pallet-staking`
  - `pallet-staking-async`
- **Minor Bumps**:
  - `frame-support`
  - `pallet-sudo`
  - `pallet-balances`
  - `pallet-conviction-voting`
  - `pallet-election-provider-multi-block`
  - `pallet-nomination-pools`
  - `pallet-proxy`
  - `pallet-referenda`
  - `pallet-scheduler`

## Impact on Moonbeam

### Severity: LOW

### Affected Areas

#### 1. Runtime Dependencies
**Location**: All three runtimes (moonbase, moonbeam, moonriver)

**Used Pallets from this PR**:
- `pallet-balances` - Core balance management
- `pallet-conviction-voting` - OpenGov voting with conviction
- `pallet-proxy` - Proxy accounts functionality
- `pallet-referenda` - OpenGov referenda
- `pallet-scheduler` - Scheduled calls
- `pallet-sudo` - Sudo privileges (likely only in moonbase)
- `frame-support` - Core FRAME primitives

**Evidence**: `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonbase/Cargo.toml` (lines 84-98)

#### 2. Precompiles
**Affected Precompiles**:
- `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/precompiles/balances-erc20/` - ERC20 interface for native balances
- `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/precompiles/conviction-voting/` - EVM interface for conviction voting
- `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/precompiles/proxy/` - EVM interface for proxy pallet
- `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/precompiles/referenda/` - EVM interface for referenda

**Impact**: These precompiles interact with the updated pallets and need to be tested to ensure compatibility.

#### 3. No Direct Code Impact
**Analysis**:
- Moonbeam does not directly use the `hypothetically` macro
- Moonbeam does not use `DefensiveTruncateFrom` or `DefensiveTruncateInto` traits
- The `DecodeWithMemTracking` changes are internal to the pallets
- Storage visibility changes are internal improvements

**Search Results**:
```bash
# No usage found
grep -r "hypothetically" moonbeam/
grep -r "DefensiveTruncate" moonbeam/
```

## Migration Path

### Step 1: Dependency Update
The pallet versions will be automatically updated when upgrading to stable2506. No code changes required in Moonbeam.

### Step 2: Testing
Focus testing on pallets that received updates:

```bash
# Test affected precompiles
cd test
pnpm moonwall test dev_moonbase -d "balances"
pnpm moonwall test dev_moonbase -d "conviction-voting"
pnpm moonwall test dev_moonbase -d "proxy"
pnpm moonwall test dev_moonbase -d "referenda"

# Run full runtime tests
cargo test -p moonbase-runtime
cargo test -p moonbeam-runtime
cargo test -p moonriver-runtime
```

### Step 3: Governance Testing
Since conviction-voting and referenda received updates, test governance functionality:
- Create and vote on test referenda
- Test conviction voting mechanisms
- Verify proxy interactions with governance

## Compatibility Notes

- **Backward Compatible**: Most changes are internal improvements
- **Breaking Changes**: The major bumps for `pallet-staking` and `pallet-staking-async` indicate API changes, but Moonbeam doesn't use these pallets
- **Public API**: Storage visibility changes and new `DefensiveTruncateInto` trait expand the public API without breaking existing code
- **Runtime Impact**: Internal improvements to memory tracking and type conversions

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Factors
1. Changes are primarily internal to pallets
2. Moonbeam doesn't directly use the modified low-level features
3. Moonbeam doesn't use `pallet-staking` (the pallet with major changes)
4. The updated pallets are stable and well-tested in the Polkadot SDK

### Medium Risk Factors
1. Multiple pallets updated simultaneously
2. Precompiles interact with updated pallets and need testing
3. Governance functionality (conviction-voting, referenda) is critical

## Recommendations

1. **Minimal Code Changes**: No Moonbeam code changes required for this PR
2. **Focus on Testing**: Prioritize testing of:
   - Governance precompiles (conviction-voting, referenda)
   - Proxy precompile
   - Balance-related functionality
3. **Integration Tests**: Run full integration test suite after update
4. **Monitor**: Watch for any unexpected behavior in governance features

## Additional Notes

This PR is part of a larger initiative to clean up the Westend network. The changes are preparatory work that improves code quality and consistency. Moonbeam benefits from these improvements without requiring code changes, but thorough testing is recommended to ensure all integrations continue to work correctly.

The major version bump for `pallet-staking` doesn't affect Moonbeam as it uses `pallet-parachain-staking` instead for its collator selection mechanism.
