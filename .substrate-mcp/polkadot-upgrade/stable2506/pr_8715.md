# PR #8715 Analysis: [AHM] Prepare For Westend Cleanup

## Overview

**PR Link:** https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8715
**Status:** Merged (June 5, 2025)
**Audience:** Runtime Developers
**Complexity:** Low - Preparatory cleanup work

## Summary

This PR extracts simpler preparatory changes from a larger effort (#7997) for easier review. It includes internal improvements to FRAME pallets focused on code quality, memory tracking, and API visibility enhancements.

## Changes Made

### 1. Macro Fix
Fixed the `hypothetically` macro to use proper `Result` type handling. This is an internal macro improvement that doesn't affect external API usage.

### 2. New Trait: DefensiveTruncateInto
Added `DefensiveTruncateInto` as a counterpart to the existing `DefensiveTruncateFrom` trait. This provides symmetric conversion capabilities with defensive truncation behavior.

### 3. Memory Tracking Enhancements
Applied `DecodeWithMemTracking` derive macro to multiple struct definitions across various pallets. This improves memory allocation tracking during decoding operations, which is important for preventing memory exhaustion attacks.

### 4. Storage Visibility Changes
Made various storage items public in affected pallets. This improves ergonomics for external tools and testing without changing the underlying functionality.

## Affected Crates

| Crate | Version Bump | Used in Moonbeam |
|-------|--------------|------------------|
| `pallet-staking` | **major** | ❌ No |
| `pallet-staking-async` | **major** | ❌ No |
| `frame-support` | minor | ✅ Yes (core) |
| `pallet-balances` | minor | ✅ Yes |
| `pallet-sudo` | minor | ✅ Yes |
| `pallet-conviction-voting` | minor | ✅ Yes |
| `pallet-referenda` | minor | ✅ Yes |
| `pallet-proxy` | minor | ✅ Yes |
| `pallet-scheduler` | minor | ✅ Yes |
| `pallet-election-provider-multi-block` | minor | ❌ No |
| `pallet-nomination-pools` | minor | ❌ No |

## Moonbeam Impact Assessment

### Affected Components

**Runtime Pallets:**
- `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonbase/src/lib.rs` (line 1420-1460)
- `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonriver/src/lib.rs`
- `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonbeam/src/lib.rs`

The following Moonbeam-used pallets are affected:
1. **pallet_balances** - Core balance management (line 1420)
2. **pallet_sudo** - Sudo functionality for testnet (line 1421)
3. **pallet_scheduler** - Task scheduling (line 1430)
4. **pallet_proxy** - Proxy accounts (line 1439)
5. **pallet_conviction_voting** - Governance voting (line 1459)
6. **pallet_referenda** - Governance referenda (line 1460)

**Precompiles:**
- `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/precompiles/proxy/src/lib.rs`
- `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/precompiles/referenda/src/lib.rs`
- `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/precompiles/conviction-voting/src/lib.rs`
- `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/precompiles/balances-erc20/src/lib.rs`

### Breaking Changes

**None for Moonbeam.** While `pallet-staking` has a major version bump, Moonbeam doesn't use this pallet (it uses `pallet-parachain-staking` instead). All other affected pallets have only minor version bumps.

### Code Compatibility

✅ **No code changes required.** Analysis shows:
- Moonbeam already imports `DecodeWithMemTracking` in runtime (line 98 of moonbase/src/lib.rs)
- No direct access to pallet storage items from precompiles
- No usage of the `hypothetically` macro in Moonbeam codebase
- No direct usage of `DefensiveTruncate` traits in custom code

### API Changes

All API changes are additive or internal:
- Storage items becoming public is non-breaking (only adds visibility)
- New `DefensiveTruncateInto` trait doesn't affect existing code
- `DecodeWithMemTracking` derives are internal improvements
- Macro fix doesn't change external behavior

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level: MINIMAL**

1. **Compilation Risk:** Low - All changes are backward compatible for Moonbeam's usage
2. **Runtime Risk:** Minimal - Changes are mostly internal improvements
3. **Testing Risk:** Low - No behavioral changes expected
4. **Migration Risk:** None - No storage migrations required

## Recommendations

### Required Actions
- ✅ **Update Polkadot SDK dependency** to include this PR
- ✅ **Run full test suite** to verify compatibility
- ✅ **Verify compilation** of all three runtimes (moonbase, moonriver, moonbeam)

### Testing Strategy
```bash
# 1. Verify compilation
cargo build --release

# 2. Run pallet tests for affected pallets
cargo test -p pallet-proxy
cargo test -p moonbase-runtime

# 3. Run governance precompile tests
pnpm moonwall test dev_moonbase -d "test-governance"

# 4. Verify balance operations
pnpm moonwall test dev_moonbase -d "test-balance"
```

### Optional Actions
- Consider adding tests for precompiles that interact with newly public storage items
- Review any custom tooling that might benefit from the newly public storage APIs

## Additional Context

### Discussion Points from PR Review
- Reviewers noted that some structs like `RewardPoint` previously lacked standard derives (`Clone`, `PartialEq`, `Eq`)
- Discussion about whether specific derives remained necessary or had become redundant
- All checks passed (244 successful checks)

### Related Work
- This PR is extracted from larger effort #7997 (Westend AHM cleanup)
- Follow-up work may include additional cleanup and improvements

## Conclusion

PR #8715 is a **low-risk, non-breaking upgrade** for Moonbeam. The changes are primarily internal improvements to FRAME pallets that don't require code modifications in Moonbeam. The PR focuses on:
- Better memory tracking
- Improved API ergonomics
- Code quality improvements

Standard upgrade procedures (dependency update, compilation verification, test suite execution) are sufficient to safely incorporate these changes.
