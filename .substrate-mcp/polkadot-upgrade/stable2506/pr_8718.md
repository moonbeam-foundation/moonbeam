# PR #8718: Record ED as Part of Storage Deposit

## Overview
- **Title**: Record ed as part of the storage deposit
- **PR Link**: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8718
- **Audience**: Runtime Dev
- **Status**: Merged

## Summary
This PR fixes an issue where the existential deposit (ED) was not properly recorded and accounted for as part of storage deposit calculations in pallet-revive. The fix ensures that gas dry-run operations include the ED in their cost calculations, improving accuracy of gas estimation.

## Changes
- **Affected Crate**: `pallet-revive` (patch bump)
- **Issue Fixed**: https://github.com/paritytech/contract-issues/issues/38

## Impact on Moonbeam

### Severity: NONE

### Analysis

**Moonbeam Does Not Use pallet-revive**

Moonbeam uses `pallet-evm` (from Frontier) for its Ethereum compatibility and smart contract execution, not `pallet-revive`.

**Evidence**:
```bash
# Search for pallet-revive usage in Moonbeam
grep -r "pallet-revive\|pallet_revive" /Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/
# Result: No matches in actual codebase (only in analysis documents)
```

**Moonbeam's Smart Contract Architecture**:
- **pallet-evm**: Executes EVM bytecode directly
- **pallet-ethereum**: Provides Ethereum RPC compatibility
- **Frontier**: Framework for Ethereum compatibility on Substrate

**What is pallet-revive?**

`pallet-revive` is a newer smart contracts pallet designed to execute EVM-compatible WASM contracts. It's different from:
- `pallet-contracts`: Substrate's native WASM contracts pallet
- `pallet-evm`: Executes actual EVM bytecode (what Moonbeam uses)

## Migration Path

### No Action Required

Since Moonbeam doesn't use pallet-revive, this PR has zero impact on the project. No code changes, testing, or special consideration is needed.

## Recommendations

1. **No Action**: This PR can be safely ignored for Moonbeam
2. **Awareness**: Be aware that pallet-revive exists as an alternative contracts solution, but it's not relevant to Moonbeam's architecture
3. **Monitoring**: No need to monitor this change in future releases

### pallet-revive vs pallet-evm

| Feature | pallet-revive | pallet-evm (Moonbeam) |
|---------|---------------|------------------------|
| Execution | EVM-compatible WASM | Native EVM bytecode |
| Gas Model | Substrate weights | Ethereum gas |
| Compatibility | Limited EVM compatibility | Full Ethereum compatibility |
| Use Case | Experimental/future | Production Ethereum dapps |

### Conclusion

This PR is completely unrelated to Moonbeam's functionality and can be safely ignored during the stable2506 upgrade process.
