# PR #8725: Snowbridge - Register Polkadot Native Asset with Fee

## Overview
- **Title**: Snowbridge: register polkadot native asset with fee
- **PR Link**: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8725
- **Audience**: Runtime Dev
- **Status**: Merged

## Summary
This PR implements fee enforcement when registering Polkadot native assets (PNA) within the Snowbridge cross-chain bridge system. The fee is converted to Ether (the bridged asset) and burned to prevent spam and maintain system sustainability.

## Changes

### Affected Crates
- `snowbridge-pallet-system-frontend` (patch, validate: false)
- `snowbridge-pallet-system-v2` (patch, validate: false)
- `asset-hub-westend-runtime` (patch)
- `bridge-hub-westend-integration-tests` (none)

### Key Features
1. **Fee Mechanism**: Requires a fee asset when registering Polkadot native assets
2. **Fee Handling**: Converts fee to Ether and burns it via `swap_fee_asset_and_burn`
3. **Root Exception**: Root origin accounts bypass fee requirements
4. **Spam Prevention**: Economic cost prevents frivolous asset registrations

## Impact on Moonbeam

### Severity: NONE

### Analysis

**Moonbeam Does Not Use Snowbridge**

Snowbridge is a bridge system between Polkadot and Ethereum that operates independently of Moonbeam. Moonbeam has its own approach to Ethereum compatibility and bridging.

**Evidence**:
```bash
# Search for Snowbridge usage in Moonbeam
grep -ri "snowbridge" /Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/
# Result: Only found in analysis documents and lock files, not in source code
```

**Architecture Differences**:

| Component | Snowbridge | Moonbeam |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| Purpose | Bridge Polkadot â†” Ethereum | Native Ethereum compatibility on Polkadot |
| Approach | Bridge pallets + smart contracts | Full EVM runtime (pallet-evm) |
| Deployment | Asset Hub + Bridge Hub | Independent parachain |
| Use Case | Asset bridging between chains | Native Ethereum dapp deployment |

**Moonbeam's Bridging Strategy**:
- **Native EVM**: Runs Ethereum smart contracts directly via pallet-evm
- **XCM Integration**: Uses XCM for cross-chain asset transfers within Polkadot
- **Third-party Bridges**: Can integrate with various bridge solutions (Axelar, Wormhole, etc.)
- **Not Snowbridge-dependent**: Moonbeam doesn't depend on Snowbridge infrastructure

## Migration Path

### No Action Required

Since Moonbeam doesn't use Snowbridge components, this PR has zero impact on the project. No code changes, testing, or special consideration is needed.

## Snowbridge vs Moonbeam

### What is Snowbridge?
Snowbridge is a trustless bridge between Polkadot and Ethereum that:
- Operates on Asset Hub and Bridge Hub parachains
- Allows transferring assets between Polkadot and Ethereum
- Uses smart contracts on Ethereum side
- Requires asset registration with fees (as per this PR)

### What is Moonbeam?
Moonbeam is an Ethereum-compatible smart contract parachain that:
- Provides native EVM execution environment
- Allows deploying Ethereum dapps without modification
- Uses XCM for Polkadot ecosystem integration
- Operates independently as a full parachain

### Why They're Different
- **Snowbridge**: Bridges assets *between* Polkadot and Ethereum networks
- **Moonbeam**: *Is* an Ethereum-compatible environment *within* Polkadot

## Recommendations

1. **No Action**: This PR can be safely ignored for Moonbeam
2. **Awareness**: Understand that Snowbridge and Moonbeam serve different purposes in the ecosystem
3. **Monitoring**: No need to monitor Snowbridge changes for Moonbeam compatibility
4. **Future Consideration**: If Moonbeam ever decides to integrate with Snowbridge for asset bridging, these fees would apply

## Additional Context

### When Would This Matter?
This PR would only matter to Moonbeam if:
1. Moonbeam decided to integrate Snowbridge for Ethereum asset bridging
2. Moonbeam users wanted to bridge assets via Snowbridge to/from Ethereum
3. Moonbeam governance decided to register Moonbeam native assets on Snowbridge

Currently, none of these scenarios apply.

## Conclusion

This PR is completely unrelated to Moonbeam's functionality and can be safely ignored during the stable2506 upgrade process. Moonbeam and Snowbridge serve complementary but distinct roles in the Polkadot ecosystem.
