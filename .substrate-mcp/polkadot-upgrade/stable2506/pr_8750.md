# PR #8750 Analysis: Move Transaction Depth Limit Checks

## Overview

**PR:** [#8750 - Move Transaction depth limit checks](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8750)
**Author:** bkchr
**Status:** Merged (June 6, 2025)
**Labels:** T1-FRAME, T18-zombienet_tests

## Summary

This PR refactors transaction depth limit validation by moving it from the `sp-api` procedural macros to `frame-executive`, making this critical security check more explicit and visible in the codebase.

## Key Changes

### 1. Depth Check Location
- **Before:** Depth limit checks were hidden inside `sp-api` procedural macros
- **After:** Checks are now explicitly performed in `frame-executive` during transaction execution

### 2. Constant Migration
The `MAX_EXTRINSIC_DEPTH` constant was moved:
```diff
-sp_api::MAX_EXTRINSIC_DEPTH
+frame_support::MAX_EXTRINSIC_DEPTH
```

### 3. Affected Crates
| Crate | Bump | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `frame-executive` | patch | Now performs explicit depth checks |
| `frame-support` | minor | New home for `MAX_EXTRINSIC_DEPTH` constant |
| `sp-api` | major | Breaking change - constant removed |
| `sp-api-proc-macro` | patch | Macro no longer performs depth checks |
| `pallet-whitelist` | patch | Updated to use new constant location |

## Impact on Moonbeam

### Positive Impacts

1. **Improved Code Clarity**
   - Transaction depth limits are now checked explicitly in `frame-executive`
   - Easier to understand and audit security-critical validation logic
   - Less "magic" happening in procedural macros

2. **Better Error Handling**
   - PR evolved to return errors instead of panicking
   - More graceful handling of depth limit violations

3. **No Breaking Changes Required**
   - Moonbeam doesn't directly use `MAX_EXTRINSIC_DEPTH` constant
   - All depth checking happens automatically through `frame_executive::Executive`

### Code Impact Analysis

**Search Results:**
```bash
# Checking for MAX_EXTRINSIC_DEPTH usage
$ rg "MAX_EXTRINSIC_DEPTH" --type rust
# No matches found in Moonbeam codebase
```

**Runtime Configuration:**
All three Moonbeam runtimes use the standard `frame_executive::Executive` configuration:

```rust
// From runtime/moonbase/src/lib.rs:1516
pub type Executive = frame_executive::Executive<
    Runtime,
    Block,
    frame_system::ChainContext<Runtime>,
    Runtime,
    AllPalletsWithSystem,
>;
```

This configuration automatically benefits from the new explicit depth checks without requiring any modifications.

## Technical Details

### Transaction Depth Limits

The transaction depth limit prevents deeply nested runtime calls that could:
- Exhaust stack space
- Enable DoS attacks through excessive recursion
- Cause unpredictable runtime behavior

**Default Value:** The `MAX_EXTRINSIC_DEPTH` constant remains set to a safe default value, now defined in `frame-support` instead of `sp-api`.

### Implementation Strategy

1. **During Block Execution:** `frame-executive` now checks transaction depth before executing each extrinsic
2. **Runtime API Calls:** Depth tracking continues through the runtime API layer
3. **Error Propagation:** Violations now return errors instead of causing panics

## Migration Required

### For Moonbeam: **NO MIGRATION NEEDED**

Moonbeam does not need any code changes because:

1. ‚úÖ No direct usage of `MAX_EXTRINSIC_DEPTH` constant found
2. ‚úÖ Standard `frame_executive::Executive` configuration in place
3. ‚úÖ No custom depth checking logic implemented
4. ‚úÖ All security checks now handled automatically by upgraded `frame-executive`

### For Reference: If Migration Were Needed

If Moonbeam had used the constant directly, the migration would be:

```diff
-use sp_api::MAX_EXTRINSIC_DEPTH;
+use frame_support::MAX_EXTRINSIC_DEPTH;
```

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Integration Tests
Verify that existing transaction processing continues to work correctly:
- Standard transaction execution
- Batch transactions
- Utility pallet calls (batch, batch_all, as_derivative)
- Proxy pallet calls with nested dispatches

### 2. Depth Limit Testing
Consider adding explicit tests for depth limits if not already covered:
```rust
// Example test scenario
#[test]
fn test_transaction_depth_limits() {
    // Test transactions at MAX_EXTRINSIC_DEPTH - 1 (should succeed)
    // Test transactions at MAX_EXTRINSIC_DEPTH (should succeed)
    // Test transactions at MAX_EXTRINSIC_DEPTH + 1 (should fail)
}
```

### 3. Smoke Tests
Run existing smoke test suite to ensure no regressions:
```bash
cd test
pnpm moonwall test smoke_moonbase
```

## Review Discussion Highlights

**Reviewer Feedback (kianenigma):**
> "It would be nice to test both on MAX_EXTRINSIC_DEPTH - 1, MAX_EXTRINSIC_DEPTH, and MAX_EXTRINSIC_DEPTH + 1 to make sure it's consistent between authoring and building."

**Author Response (bkchr):**
> "If max works, the lower values should also work."

The discussion reflects a focus on ensuring the depth limits work consistently across both transaction authoring (client-side) and block building (runtime-side).

## Security Considerations

### Positive Security Improvements

1. **Explicit Validation:** Depth checks are now visible and explicit rather than hidden in macros
2. **Consistent Enforcement:** Unified checking logic in `frame-executive` ensures consistent behavior
3. **Better Error Handling:** Errors instead of panics provide more predictable failure modes

### No New Security Risks

This is a refactoring that maintains the same security properties while improving code organization.

## Recommendations

### For Moonbeam Team

1. ‚úÖ **No Code Changes Required** - This is a transparent improvement
2. ‚úÖ **Run Standard Test Suite** - Ensure no regressions in transaction processing
3. ‚úÖ **Review After Upgrade** - Verify all three runtimes (Moonbase, Moonriver, Moonbeam) work correctly
4. üìù **Consider Additional Tests** - Add explicit depth limit tests if desired for extra confidence

### Priority Level: **LOW**

This is an internal refactoring that doesn't require immediate action but should be verified during the stable2506 upgrade testing phase.

## Related PRs

This PR is part of a broader effort to improve FRAME's transaction handling and security validation:
- Related to general transaction processing improvements in frame-executive
- Part of the ongoing effort to make security-critical checks more explicit and auditable

## Conclusion

PR #8750 is a positive refactoring that improves code organization and visibility of transaction depth limit checks. Moonbeam requires **no code changes** and will automatically benefit from the improved implementation when upgrading to stable2506.

The main value is increased code clarity and maintainability, with the security properties remaining identical to the previous implementation. Standard testing procedures should be sufficient to verify correct operation after the upgrade.
