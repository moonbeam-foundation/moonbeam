# PR #8891: RuntimeAllocator - Align Returned Pointers

## Overview

**PR Link:** https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8891
**Crate:** `sp-io`
**Bump Level:** Patch
**Audience:** Runtime Dev

## Summary

This PR fixes a critical memory alignment issue in the runtime allocator that emerged due to Rust's change in default alignment for `u128` types from 8 bytes to 16 bytes (announced in [Rust blog post from March 2024](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/03/30/i128-layout-update/)).

The host allocator previously assumed a maximum alignment of 8 bytes, which broke when Rust updated its alignment requirements for `u128` and `i128` types. This caused panics in benchmarks and any code using operations like `slice::from_raw_parts` with these types.

## Technical Changes

### Root Cause
- Rust changed default alignment for `u128`/`i128` from 8 bytes to 16 bytes
- The runtime's host allocator assumed max 8-byte alignment
- Misaligned pointers caused panics during memory operations

### Solution
The runtime allocator now handles pointer alignment internally by:

1. **Requesting Extra Memory:** When an allocation needs alignment > 8 bytes, the allocator requests additional memory from the host to allow for alignment adjustment
2. **Storing Offset Data:** The allocator stores the alignment offset in the unused bytes of the host allocator's header
3. **Returning Aligned Pointers:** Returns properly aligned pointers (up to 16 bytes) to callers
4. **Deallocation Tracking:** Reads the stored offset during deallocation to correctly free memory

### Implementation Details
- Uses `write_unaligned` and `read_unaligned` for safe pointer manipulation
- Exploits knowledge of the host allocator's internal header structure
- Host-side allocations remain 8-byte aligned (primarily used for `u8` arrays)
- Any host-side alignment change would be consensus-breaking

## Impact on Moonbeam

### Critical Relevance

This fix is **highly critical** for Moonbeam because:

1. **Extensive u128 Usage:** Moonbeam's codebase has **397 occurrences of u128 across 94 files**
2. **Balance Type:** All Balance types in Moonbeam runtimes use `u128`:
   ```rust
   pub type Balance = u128;
   ```
3. **Custom u128 Wrappers:** Moonbeam has custom types like `BoundedU128` that wrap `u128` values
4. **Core Runtime Operations:** Balance calculations, weights, and amount handling all depend on proper u128 alignment

### Files with Extensive u128 Usage

Key Moonbeam components using u128:
- **Runtimes:** `/runtime/moonbeam/src/lib.rs` (12 occurrences)
- **Runtimes:** `/runtime/moonriver/src/lib.rs` (12 occurrences)
- **Runtimes:** `/runtime/moonbase/src/lib.rs` (13 occurrences)
- **Common Types:** `/runtime/common/src/types.rs` (11 occurrences) - includes `BoundedU128` definition
- **Common APIs:** `/runtime/common/src/apis.rs` (9 occurrences)
- **Pallets:** `/pallets/xcm-weight-trader/src/lib.rs` (17 occurrences)
- **Pallets:** `/pallets/xcm-transactor/src/lib.rs` (12 occurrences)
- **Pallets:** `/pallets/parachain-staking/src/inflation.rs` (7 occurrences)

### Risk Assessment

**Without this fix:**
- Runtime benchmarks could panic
- Balance operations might fail unpredictably
- Memory corruption risks in any code manipulating u128 values
- Potential consensus failures across the network

**With this fix:**
- All u128 allocations are properly aligned to 16 bytes
- Safe memory operations for balance calculations
- Benchmark stability restored
- No migration required

## Breaking Changes

**None** - This is a patch-level fix with no breaking API changes.

However, it is a **consensus-level change** because it modifies how the runtime allocator behaves. This means:
- All nodes must upgrade together (which happens naturally with runtime upgrades)
- The change is transparent to runtime developers
- No code changes required in Moonbeam's codebase

## Migration Requirements

**No migration required.**

This is a drop-in fix that works automatically once the Polkadot SDK dependency is updated. The runtime allocator change is internal and transparent to application code.

## Testing Recommendations

While no specific migration is needed, testing should verify:

1. **Benchmark Execution:** Ensure all runtime benchmarks complete without panics
   ```bash
   ./scripts/run-benches-for-runtime.sh moonbase release
   ./scripts/run-benches-for-runtime.sh moonriver release
   ./scripts/run-benches-for-runtime.sh moonbeam release
   ```

2. **Balance Operations:** Run integration tests that exercise balance transfers and calculations
   ```bash
   cd test
   pnpm moonwall test dev_moonbase
   ```

3. **u128 Heavy Operations:** Focus testing on:
   - Balance transfers (native and ERC20)
   - Staking operations (reward calculations)
   - XCM transfers (amount conversions)
   - Governance operations (vote amounts)

## Implementation Tradeoffs

### Advantages
- Fixes immediate alignment panics
- Maintains consensus compatibility (no host-side changes)
- Transparent to runtime developers
- Minimal performance overhead

### Limitations
- Host-side pointers remain 8-byte aligned
  - Acceptable because host mainly allocates `u8` arrays
- Relies on knowledge of host allocator internals
  - Pragmatic given consensus constraints
- Not a "perfect" solution but necessary due to consensus requirements

## Recommendation

**Action: Accept and integrate this PR**

This is a critical stability fix that directly impacts Moonbeam's runtime execution. The extensive use of u128 types throughout Moonbeam's codebase makes this alignment fix essential for:
- Runtime stability
- Benchmark reliability
- Balance operation safety
- Consensus integrity

The fix is well-designed given the constraints and has no migration burden on Moonbeam developers or operators.
