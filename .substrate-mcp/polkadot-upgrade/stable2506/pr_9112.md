# PR #9112: Fix seal_call benchmark

**Impact**: INHERITED
**Confidence**: High
**Affected Components**: None (Moonbeam-specific)

## Changes Detected

This PR fixes the `seal_call` benchmark in the `pallet-revive` crate by ensuring the benchmarked block actually succeeds. The changes update weights for various `seal_*` functions:

- **seal_call**: Time increased from 266.54µs to 406.06µs (+52.34%)
- Other seal_* function weights also updated to reflect more accurate measurements

The PR improves benchmark accuracy and ensures more reliable weight calculations for smart contract interactions.

## Project Impact

**No direct impact on Moonbeam.**

Moonbeam uses **pallet-evm** (from Frontier) for Ethereum compatibility, not pallet-revive. The pallet-revive crate is only present in Moonbeam's dependency tree as a transitive dependency from upstream Polkadot SDK crates (specifically pallet-assets).

### Evidence from Codebase:

1. **Moonbeam uses pallet-evm**: All three runtimes (moonbase, moonriver, moonbeam) depend on pallet-evm and fp-evm (Frontier):
   - `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonbase/Cargo.toml:133`: `pallet-evm = { workspace = true, features = ["forbid-evm-reentrancy"] }`
   - `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonbase/Cargo.toml:129`: `fp-evm = { workspace = true }`

2. **pallet-revive only in Cargo.lock**: Search of the entire codebase shows pallet-revive only appears in:
   - `Cargo.lock` (as a transitive dependency of pallet-assets)
   - Previous PR analysis files in `.substrate-mcp` directory
   - No direct usage in any runtime, pallet, or precompile

3. **Moonbeam's EVM architecture**:
   - Precompiles use `pallet-evm-precompile-*` crates
   - Custom pallets interact with pallet-evm, not pallet-revive
   - EVM tracing and RPC layers built on Frontier (pallet-evm)

## Evidence & References

### Dependency Analysis:
```bash
# pallet-revive appears only in Cargo.lock
$ rg -l "pallet-revive" --type toml
Cargo.lock

# pallet-revive is a dependency of pallet-assets (from Polkadot SDK)
$ rg -B 20 "\"pallet-revive\"," Cargo.lock | rg "^name = " | tail -1
name = "pallet-assets"
```

### Runtime Configuration:
All Moonbeam runtimes use pallet-evm:
- `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonbase/Cargo.toml`
- `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonriver/Cargo.toml`
- `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/runtime/moonbeam/Cargo.toml`

## Conclusion

This PR has **no actionable impact** on Moonbeam. The weight changes in pallet-revive do not affect Moonbeam's EVM implementation since:

1. Moonbeam uses pallet-evm (Frontier), not pallet-revive
2. pallet-revive is only a transitive dependency from upstream Polkadot SDK
3. No code changes required in Moonbeam

The updated weights will be automatically inherited when updating the Polkadot SDK dependency, but they have no functional impact on Moonbeam's operation.
