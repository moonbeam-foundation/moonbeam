# PR #9264: gossip-support: make low connectivity message an error

**Impact**: INHERITED
**Confidence**: High
**Affected Components**: None (Node operational behavior only)

## Changes Detected

This PR modifies the `polkadot-gossip-support` subsystem to:
- Change low connectivity warning to error level for better visibility
- Reduce connectivity threshold to 85% to avoid triggering too eagerly
- Improve monitoring of validator network connectivity issues

The change is purely related to logging and metrics in the Polkadot validator node's gossip support subsystem.

## Project Impact

**No direct impact on Moonbeam codebase.**

Moonbeam is a parachain that uses `cumulus-relay-chain-minimal-node` to interact with the relay chain, not a full Polkadot validator node. The gossip-support subsystem is part of the relay chain validator infrastructure and is not used in parachain collator nodes.

### Architecture Analysis

1. **Dependency Chain**:
   - `polkadot-gossip-support` is a dependency of `polkadot-service` (found in Cargo.lock:12812)
   - `polkadot-service` is used only in `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/node/cli/Cargo.toml:37`
   - Moonbeam uses `cumulus-relay-chain-minimal-node` for relay chain interaction (node/service/Cargo.toml:125)

2. **Node Service Implementation**:
   - `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/node/service/src/lib.rs:633` uses `build_minimal_relay_chain_node_with_rpc()`
   - `/Users/manuelmauro/Workspace/moonbeam/node/service/src/lib.rs:41` imports `OverseerHandle` but only for relay chain interface
   - Lines 924-925, 941, 965 show `overseer_handle` usage is limited to relay chain interface abstraction

3. **Subsystem Isolation**:
   - Moonbeam collators do NOT run the gossip-support subsystem
   - The subsystem is only active in full relay chain validator nodes
   - Parachain collators use a minimal relay chain interface that doesn't include validator-specific subsystems

### Cargo Dependency Analysis
```
Cargo.lock:12035: name = "polkadot-gossip-support"
Cargo.lock:12812: "polkadot-gossip-support" (as dependency of polkadot-service)

### Node Implementation
```rust
// node/service/src/lib.rs:40
use cumulus_relay_chain_inprocess_interface::build_inprocess_relay_chain;
use cumulus_relay_chain_minimal_node::build_minimal_relay_chain_node_with_rpc;

// node/service/src/lib.rs:633

```

### Relay Chain Interface Usage
```rust
// node/service/src/lib.rs:41
use cumulus_relay_chain_interface::{OverseerHandle, RelayChainInterface, RelayChainResult};

// node/service/src/lib.rs:924-925
let overseer_handle = relay_chain_interface
    .overseer_handle()
```

## Conclusion

This PR has **INHERITED** impact - the change will be automatically included when upgrading to stable2506, but it requires no code changes in Moonbeam. The gossip-support subsystem operates within the relay chain validator infrastructure and does not affect parachain collator operations.

The improved error visibility may benefit relay chain operators monitoring validator connectivity, but Moonbeam parachain collators will not see these errors as they don't run the gossip-support subsystem.

**Action Required**: None. This change is automatically inherited and requires no modifications to Moonbeam's codebase.
