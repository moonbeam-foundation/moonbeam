## Run an alphanet node with Docker

Docker images are published for every tagged release. Learn more with `moonbeam --help`.

```bash
# Join the public testnet
docker run --network="host" purestake/moonbeam:v0.31.0 --chain alphanet
```

You can find more detailed instructions to [run a full node in our TestNet](https://docs.moonbeam.network/node-operators/networks/full-node/)

## Run a local development node with Docker

Developers who are building dApps to run on moonbeam, may want a lightweight node to work with
locally. You can quickly spin up a single node with no relay chain backing it using the development
service.

```bash
# Run a dev service node
docker run --network="host" purestake/moonbeam:v0.31.0 --dev
```

For more information, see our detailed instructions to [run a development node](https://docs.moonbeam.network/getting-started/local-node/setting-up-a-node/)

### Sealing options

The command above will start the node in instant seal mode. It creates a block when a transaction arrives, similar to Ganache's auto-mine. You can also choose to author blocks at a regular interval, or control authoring manually through the RPC.

```bash
# Author a block every 6 seconds.
docker run --network="host" purestake/moonbeam:v0.31.0 --dev --sealing 6000

# Manually control the block authorship and finality
docker run --network="host" purestake/moonbeam:v0.31.0 --dev --sealing manual
```

### Prefunded Development Addresses

Running Moonbeam in development mode will pre-fund several well-known addresses that (mostly) contain the letters "th" in their names to remind you that they are for ethereum-compatible usage. These addresses are derived from
Substrate's canonical mnemonic: `bottom drive obey lake curtain smoke basket hold race lonely fit walk`

## Build the Moonbeam Node

To build Moonbeam, you will need a proper Substrate development environment. If you've never worked with a Substrate-based blockchain before, you should probably try the [Setting Up a Moonbeam Node](https://docs.moonbeam.network/getting-started/local-node/setting-up-a-node/) docs first.

If you need a refresher setting up your Substrate environment, see [Substrate's Getting Started Guide](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/getting-started/).

Note that cloning master might result in an unstable build. If you want a stable version, check out the [latest releases](https://github.com/PureStake/moonbeam/releases).

```bash
# Fetch the code
git clone https://github.com/PureStake/moonbeam
cd moonbeam

# Build the node (The first build will be long (~30min))
cargo build --release
```

## Run tests

Moonbeam has Rust unit tests as well as typescript integration tests. These tests are run in CI, and can also be run locally.

```bash
# Run the Rust unit tests
cargo test
```

```bash
# Install dependencies for integration tests
cd moonbeam-types-bundle
npm i

cd ../tests
npm i

# Run integration tests
npm test
```

## Chain IDs

The Ethereum specification described a numeric Chain Id. The Moonbeam mainnet Chain Id will be 1284
because it takes 1284 milliseconds for a moonbeam to reach Earth.

Moonbeam nodes support multiple public chains and testnets, with the following Chain Ids.

| Network Description                | Chain ID    |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Local Parachain TestNet            | 1280        |
| Local Development TestNet          | 1281        |
| Reserved for other TestNets        | 1282 - 1283 |
| Moonbeam (Polkadot)                | 1284        |
| Moonriver (Kusama)                 | 1285        |
| Moonrock (Rococo)                  | 1286        |
| Moonbase Alpha TestNet             | 1287        |
| Reserved for other public networks | 1288 - 1289 |

## Runtime Architecture

The Moonbeam Runtime is built using FRAME and consists of pallets from substrate, frontier, cumulus, and `pallets/`.

From substrate:

- _Utility_: Allows users to use derivative accounts, and batch calls
- _Balances_: Tracks GLMR token balances
- _Sudo_: Allows a privileged account to make arbitrary runtime changes - will be removed before
  launch
- _Timestamp_: On-Chain notion of time
- _Transaction Payment_: Transaction payment (fee) management
- _Randomness Collective Flip_: A (mock) onchain randomness beacon. Will be replaced by parachain
  randomness by mainnet.

From frontier:

- _EVM_: Encapsulates execution logic for an Ethereum Virtual Machine
- _Ethereum_: Ethereum-style data encoding and access for the EVM.

From cumulus:

- _ParachainUpgrade_: A helper to perform runtime upgrades on parachains
- _ParachainInfo_: A place to store parachain-relevant constants like parachain id

The following pallets are stored in `pallets/`. They are designed for Moonbeam's specific requirements:

- _Ethereum Chain Id_: A place to store the chain id for each Moonbeam network
- _Author Inherent_: Allows block authors to include their identity in a block via an inherent
- _Parachain Staking_: Minimal staking pallet that selects collators by total amount at stake

When modifying the git repository for these dependencies, a tool called [diener](https://github.com/bkchr/diener) can be used to replace the git URL and branch for each reference in all `Cargo.toml` files with a single command. This alleviates a lot of the repetitive modifications necessary when changing dependency versions.
