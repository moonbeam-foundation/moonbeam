## Run a Moonbase Alpha (Moonbeam TestNet) Node with Docker

Docker images are published for every tagged release. Learn more with `moonbeam --help`.

```bash
# Join the public testnet
docker run --network="host" moonbeamfoundation/moonbeam:v0.37.3 --chain alphanet
```

You can find more detailed instructions to [run a full node in our TestNet](https://docs.moonbeam.network/node-operators/networks/run-a-node/overview/)

## Run a Local Development Node with Docker

Developers who are building dApps to run on Moonbeam, may want a lightweight node to work with
locally. You can quickly set up a single node without a relay chain backing it using the development service.

```bash
# Run a dev service node
docker run --network="host" moonbeamfoundation/moonbeam:v0.37.3 --dev
```

For more information, see our detailed instructions to [run a development node](https://docs.moonbeam.network/builders/get-started/networks/moonbeam-dev/)

### Sealing Options

The above command will start the node in instant seal mode. It creates a block when a transaction arrives, similar to Ganache's auto-mine. You can also choose to author blocks at a regular interval, or control authoring manually through the RPC.

```bash
# Author a block every 6 seconds.
docker run --network="host" moonbeamfoundation/moonbeam:v0.36.0 --dev --sealing 6000

# Manually control the block authorship and finality
docker run --network="host" moonbeamfoundation/moonbeam:v0.36.0 --dev --sealing manual
```

### Prefunded Development Addresses

Running Moonbeam in development mode will pre-fund several well-known addresses that (mostly) contain the letters "th" in their names to remind you that they are for ethereum-compatible usage. These addresses are derived from
Substrate's canonical mnemonic: `bottom drive obey lake curtain smoke basket hold race lonely fit walk`

## Build the Moonbeam Node

To build Moonbeam, a proper Substrate development environment is required. If you're new to working with Substrate-based blockchains, consider starting with the [Getting Started with a Moonbeam Development Node](https://docs.moonbeam.network/builders/get-started/networks/moonbeam-dev/) documentation.

If you need a refresher setting up your Substrate environment, see [Substrate's Getting Started Guide](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/getting-started/).

Please note that cloning the master branch might result in an unstable build. If you want a stable version, check out the [latest releases](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/releases).

```bash
# Fetch the code
git clone https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam
cd moonbeam

# Build the node (The first build will be long (~30min))
cargo build --release
```

## Run Tests

Moonbeam incorporates Rust unit tests and TypeScript integration tests, which are executed in CI and can also be run locally.

```bash
# Run the Rust unit tests
cargo test
```

> [!IMPORTANT]\
> If you do not have **pnpm**, you can install with: `npm install -g pnpm`

```bash
cd test
pnpm i 
pnpm moonwall test dev_moonbase
```

## Chain IDs

The Ethereum specification describes a numeric Chain Id. The Moonbeam mainnet will have a Chain Id 
of 1284, symbolizing the 1284 milliseconds it takes for a Moonbeam to reach Earth.

Moonbeam nodes support a variety of public chains and testnets, each with their respective Chain Ids as follows:

| Network Description                | Chain ID    | Target Relay Runtime |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
| Local Parachain TestNet            | 1280        |                      |
| Local Development TestNet          | 1281        |                      |
| Reserved for other TestNets        | 1282 - 1283 |                      |
| Moonbeam                           | 1284        | Polkadot             |
| Moonriver                          | 1285        | Kusama               |
| Moonrock                           | 1286        | Rococo               |
| Moonbase Alpha TestNet             | 1287        | Westend              |
| Reserved for other public networks | 1288 - 1289 |                      |

Note that the runtimes can also be configured to target different relay networks.

## Runtime Architecture

The Moonbeam Runtime, built using FRAME, comprises pallets from Polkadot-SDK, Frontier, and the `pallets/` directory.

From Polkadot-SDK:

- _Utility_: Allows users to use derivative accounts, and batch calls
- _Balances_: Tracks GLMR token balances
- _Sudo_: Allows a privileged account to make arbitrary runtime changes. This will be removed before launch.
- _Timestamp_: On-Chain notion of time
- _Transaction Payment_: Transaction payment (fee) management
- _Randomness Collective Flip_: A (mock) onchain randomness beacon, which will be replaced by parachain randomness by mainnet.
- _ParachainUpgrade_: A helper to perform runtime upgrades on parachains
- _ParachainInfo_: A place to store parachain-relevant constants like parachain id

From Frontier:

- _EVM Chain Id_: A place to store the chain id for each Moonbeam network
- _EVM_: Encapsulates execution logic for an Ethereum Virtual Machine
- _Ethereum_: Ethereum-style data encoding and access for the EVM.

The following pallets are stored in `pallets/`. They are designed for Moonbeam's specific requirements:

- _Author Inherent_: Allows block authors to include their identity in a block via an inherent.
- _Parachain Staking_: Minimal staking pallet that selects collators by total amount at stake

When modifying the git repository for these dependencies, a tool called [diener](https://github.com/bkchr/diener) can be used to replace the git URL and branch for each reference in all `Cargo.toml` files with a single command. This alleviates a lot of the repetitive modifications necessary when changing dependency versions.
