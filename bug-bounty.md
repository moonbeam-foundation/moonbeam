# Bug Bounty

The Moonbeam bug bounty program is focused on the Moonriver and Moonbeam Parachains (deployed to Kusama and Polkadot respectively) and dapps. We only accept bug bounty reports via the Immunefi program at [https://immunefi.com/bounty/moonbeamnetwork/](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam.git)
