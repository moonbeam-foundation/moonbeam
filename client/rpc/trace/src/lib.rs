//! `trace_filter` RPC handler and its associated service task.
//! The RPC handler rely on `CacheTask` which provides a future that must be run inside a tokio
//! executor.
//!
//! The implementation is composed of multiple tasks :
//! - Many calls the the RPC handler `Trace::filter`, communicating with the main task.
//! - A main `CacheTask` managing the cache and the communication between tasks.
//! - For each traced block an async task responsible to wait for a permit, spawn a blocking
//!   task and waiting for the result, then send it to the main `CacheTask`.
