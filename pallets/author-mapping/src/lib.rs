//! Maps Author Ids as used in nimbus consensus layer to account ids as used i nthe runtime.
//! This should likely be moved to nimbus eventually.
//!
//! This pallet maps AuthorId => AccountId which is most useful when using propositional style
//! queries. This mapping will likely need to go the other way if using exhaustive authority sets.
//! That could either be a seperate pallet, or this pallet could implement a two-way mapping. But
//! for now it it one-way
