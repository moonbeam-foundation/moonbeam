//! A pallet to put your runtime into a restricted maintenance or safe mode. This is useful when
//! performing site maintenance, running data migrations, or protecting the chain during an attack.
//!
//! This introduces one storage read to fetch the base filter for each extrinsic. Hoever, it should
//! be that the state cache eliminates this cost almost entirely. I wonder if that can or should be
//! reflected in the weight calculation.
//!
//! Possible future improvements
//! 1. This could be more configureable by letting the runtime developer specify a type (probably an
//! enum) that can be converted into a filter. Similar end result (but different implementation) as
//! Acala has it
//! github.com/AcalaNetwork/Acala/blob/pause-transaction/modules/transaction-pause/src/lib.rs#L71
//!
//! 2. Automatically enable maintenance mode after a long timeout is detected between blocks.
//! To implement this we would couple to the timestamp pallet and store the timestamp of the
//! previous block.
//!
//! 3. Different origins for entering and leaving maintenance mode.
//!
//! 4. Maintenance mode timeout. To avoid getting stuck in maintenance mode. It could automatically
//! switch back to normal mode after a pre-decided number of blocks. Maybe there could be an
//! extrinsic to extend the maintenance time.
//!
//! 5. Let the runtime developer configure which pallets' on_initialize and on_finalize hooks get
//! called. This would allow to determine whether eg staking elections should still occur and
//! democracy referenda still mature
