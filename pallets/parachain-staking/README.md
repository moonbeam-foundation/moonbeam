# DPoS Pallet for Parachain Staking

## Formatting Rules

- dependencies in alphabetical order in the `Cargo.toml` and at the top of each file
- prefer explicit imports to glob import syntax i.e. prefer `use::crate::{Ex1, Ex2, ..};` to `use super::*;`

## History

Since January 2021, Moonbeam's team has maintained this Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) pallet designed specifically for parachains.

Since April 2021, the development of this pallet has been supported by [a Web3 Foundation grant](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/389). The [first milestone](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/pull/218) was approved in June 2021.
