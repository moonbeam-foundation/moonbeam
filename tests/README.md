# Functional testing for Moonbeam

This folder contains a set of functional tests designed for Moonbeam network.

It is written in typescript, using Mocha/Chai as Test framework.

## Test flow

Each group will start a dev service with the
[development spec](../node/service/src/chain_spec) before executing the tests.

## Test categories

- `test`: Tests expected to run by spawning a new dev node (~1-2 minutes)
- `para-test`: Tests spawning a complete relay+para network (~5-20 minutes)
- `smoke-test`: Tests veryfing the data (consistency) on an existing chain (~5-20 minutes)

## Installation

```
npm install
```

## Run the tests

```
npm run test
```

and to print more information:

```
npm run test-with-logs
```

# Smoke tests

## Adding smoke tests

Smoke test should only contains consistency/state checks.

Testing the consistency is usually simple:

- When you have redundant information: Verify they match:  
  `totalIssuance == sum(accounts.map(acc => acc.free + acc.reserved))`
- When you have conditional state: Verify the condition is valid:  
  `parachainStaking.topDelegations.each(top => top.length <= parachainStaking.maxTopDelegationsPerCandidate)`
- When you expect specific state: Verify it exists:  
  `assets.assets.length > 0` or `maintenanceMode.maintenanceMode == false`)

Smoke tests should **never** send an extrinsic to modify the state.  
They should be split by pallet and only need 1 `describeSmokeSuite` per file.

## Running smoke tests

In order to use smoke tests, you need to provide a blockchain:

```
WSS_URL=wss://localhost:9944 npm run smoke-test
```

You can debug specific smoke test with `debug` library using prefix `smoke:*`:

```
DEBUG=smoke:* WSS_URL=wss://localhost:9944 npm run smoke-test
```

# Parachain test

Either use script or use parachain testing framework.

## Using Script

You can directly launch a parachain test with this script.
It takes care of getting the binary relay node and spawns 2 validators and 2 collators.

```bash
scripts/run-para-test-single.sh moonriver/test-balance-genesis.ts
```

## Using parachain testing framework

### Requirements

First make sure you have compiled moonbeam with `cargo build --release` and also copied
the polkadot executable (built with `cargo build --release`) into the same folder as
the moonbeam executable: `./target/release`
(`cp ./target/release/polkadot ../moonbeam/target/release/polkadot`).

Also don't forget to build `moonbeam-types-bundle` with `yarn run build` in that folder.

### Execution

Then run `npm run para-test-no-ci` to run the parachain tests in the para-tests-no-ci folder.

This script is prefixed with `DEBUG=test:substrateEvents ` to log events during the tests.

## Write Tests

### Add a new contract

- Add contract source code to `contracts/sources.ts`
- Run `npm run pre-build-contracts`=> This will generate the necessary abi and byte code
- Create your contract with
  `const { contract, rawTx } = await createContract(context.web3, "TestContract");`

## Verbose mode

You can also add the node's logs to the output using the `MOONBEAM_LOG` env variable. Ex:

```
MOONBEAM_LOG="warn,rpc=trace" npm run test
```

The test script will find available ports above 20000 in order to ensure that it doesn't conflict
with any other running services.

# Debugging a Moonbeam node

The repository contains a pre-configured debugger configuration for VSCode with the **CodeLLDB**
(`vadimcn.vscode-lldb`) extension.

Before debugging, you need to build the node with debug symbols with command
`RUSTFLAGS=-g cargo build --release` (available as a VSCode task). Then go in the **Debug** tab in
the left bar of VSCode and make sure **Launch Moonbeam Node (Linux)** is selected in the top
dropdown. **Build & Launch Moonbeam Node (Linux)** will trigger the build before launching the node.

Depending on what exactly you're attempting to debug, you may need other build configurations. The
most straightforward is a debug build (omit `--release`), but this will produce a binary which is
extremely large and performs very poorly. A `--release` build can provide some middle ground, and
you may need some or all of:

- `-g` (alias for `-C debuginfo=2`, the max)
- `-C force-frame-pointers=yes`
- `-Copt-level=0` (or 1, etc. This one has a big impact)

To launch the debug session click on the green "play" arrow next to the dropdown. It will take some
time before the node starts, but the terminal containing the node output will appear when it is
really starting. The node is listening on ports 19931 (p2p), 19932 (rpc) and 19933 (ws).

You can explore the code and place a breakpoint on a line by left clicking on the left of the line
number. The execution will pause the next time this line is reached. The debug toolbar contains the
following buttons :

- Resume/Pause : Resume the execution if paused, pause the execution at the current location
  (pretty random) if running.
- Step over : Resume the execution until next line, or go one level up if the end of the current
  scope is reached.
- Step into : Resume the execution to go inside the immediatly next function call if any, otherwise
  step to next line.
- Step out : Resume the execution until the end of the scope is reached.
- Restart : Kill the program and start a new debuging session.
- Stop : Kill the program and end debugin session.

Breakpoints stay between debugging sessions. When multiple function calls are made on the same line,
multiple step into, step out, step into, ... can be requiered to go inside one of the chained
calls.

When paused, content of variables is showed in the debuging tab of VSCode. Some basic types are
displayed correctly (primitive types, Vec, Arc) but more complex types such as HashMap/BTreeMap
are not "smartly" displayed (content of the struct is shown by mapping is hidden in the complexity
of the implementation).

## Running Typescript tests with a debug node

By setting the environement variable `DEBUG_MODE=true`, the Typescript tests will not spawn its
own node and instead will connect to an external node running on ports 19931/19932/19933, which
are the ports used by the debug node.

A VSCode test allow to quickly run the `test-single` test in debug mode. To run another test,
change the command in the `package.json`. Note that you should restart the node after running
one test file.

## Fork Tests

Those tests are intended to run using an exported state from an existing network.  
They require to specify the exported state, the runtime name and the parachain id.  
Also the exported state needs to be modified using the state-modifier.ts script.

### End to end script (automated)

You can run the full process using the docker image:

```
docker run -e GIT_TAG=perm-runtime-1605 -e NETWORK=moonriver -e RUNTIME_NAME=moonriver purestake/moonbeam-fork-tests:0.0.5
```

or locally (for debugging pruposes) with the script:

```
ROOT_FOLDER=/tmp/moonbeam-states GIT_TAG=perm-runtime-1604 NETWORK=moonbase-alpha RUNTIME_NAME=moobase ./scripts/run-fork-test.sh
```

Where `ROOT_FOLDER` should be an empty folder

### Retrieving exported state (manual step 1)

```
mkdir -p ~/projects/moonbeam-states
for network in moonbase-alpha moonriver moonbeam; do wget https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/snapshots.moonbeam.network/${network}/latest/${network}-state.json -O ~/projects/moonbeam-states/${network}-state.json; done
```

### Modifying exported state (manual step 2)

```
for network in moonbase-alpha moonriver moonbeam; do node_modules/.bin/ts-node state-modifier.ts ~/projects/moonbeam-states/${network}-state.json; done
```

### Executing the tests (manual step 3a)

Here is an exemple of the command to run:

```
SKIP_INTERMEDIATE_RUNTIME=true RUNTIME_NAME=moonbeam SPEC_FILE=~/projects/moonbeam-states/moonbeam-state.mod.json PARA_ID=2004 PORT_PREFIX=51 npm run fork-test
SKIP_INTERMEDIATE_RUNTIME=true RUNTIME_NAME=moonbase SPEC_FILE=~/projects/moonbeam-states/moonbase-alpha-state.mod.json PARA_ID=1000 PORT_PREFIX=52 npm run fork-test

SKIP_INTERMEDIATE_RUNTIME=true RUNTIME_NAME=moonriver SPEC_FILE=~/projects/moonbeam-states/moonriver-state.mod.json PARA_ID=2023 PORT_PREFIX=53 npm run fork-test
```

### Starting the node separately

If you want to inspect the forkned network or keep it running after the tests

```
PARA_ID=2004 PORT_PREFIX=51 ./node_modules/.bin/ts-node spawn-fork-node.ts
PARA_ID=1000 PORT_PREFIX=51 ./node_modules/.bin/ts-node spawn-fork-node.ts
PARA_ID=2023 PORT_PREFIX=51 ./node_modules/.bin/ts-node spawn-fork-node.ts
```

### Generating moonbeam-fork-test image

```
docker build ./scripts -t purestake/moonbeam-fork-tests:0.0.5 -f docker/moonbeam-fork-tests.Dockerfile
```
