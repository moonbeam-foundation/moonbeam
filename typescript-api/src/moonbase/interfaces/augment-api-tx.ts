       *   [`Config::PayoutPeriod`]. If `None`, the spend can be claimed immediately after approval.

       * `fee` is the amount to be spent to pay for execution in destination chain. Both fee and
       * amount will be subtracted form the callers balance.
       *
       * If `fee` is not high enough to cover for the execution costs in the destination chain, then
       * the assets will be trapped in the destination chain
       *
       * It's a no-op if any error on local XCM execution or message sending. Note sending assets
       * out per se doesn't guarantee they would be received. Receiving depends on if the XCM
       * message could be delivered by the network, and if the receiving chain would handle messages
       * correctly.
